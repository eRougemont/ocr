THE HEART OF EUROPE<lb/>
by Denis de Rougemont and Charlotte Muret<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block">
Alone in Europe today there exists, untouched, one<lb/>
last living democracy, the oldest democracy in the<lb/>
world: Switzerland. Surrounded by threats, apparently<lb/>
at the mercy of the totalitarians, it has maintained<lb/>
its centuries-old traditions of Federalism and<lb/>
Protestantism, of many tongues and many nationalities.<lb/>
It is a beautiful country of immense mountains,<lb/>
fields of snow, clock towers, cheeses, Alpine chalets ;<lb/>
yet it is not because of these that it still survives<lb/>
today.<lb/>
What is the Swiss way of life ? What is their form<lb/>
and philosophy of government ? What has been its<lb/>
history, its historical tradition ? What is its national<lb/>
culture ? And what, above all, is its role in the world<lb/>
today ? In THE HEART OF EUROPE one of<lb/>
the great Swiss citizens, a man of international reputation<lb/>
as a thinker and political philosopher, examines<lb/>
his country, describes, in collaboration with<lb/>
Charlotte Muret, how Switzerland became what it<lb/>
is today, and penetratingly analyzes its present life<lb/>
and purposes. The authors express, with heartening<lb/>
hope, the full belief that in this tense and guarded<lb/>
nation exists at this moment the form of government<lb/>
and the ways of life which will, in future time, provide<lb/>
the models for a reconstruction of our sorry<lb/>
world.<lb/>

PREFACE<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big"><space/>This volume is neither a guide book nor a history<lb/>
of Switzerland. It is not even an exhaustive study of<lb/>
that country in any of its aspects. It is a description<lb/>
of how one people has managed to remain free and<lb/>
diverse yet united.<lb/>
<space/>We believe that Federalism in the sense of such a<lb/>
union of diversities is the most vital necessity of the<lb/>
future, and that all who care for freedom and democracy<lb/>
should realize it. This belief has led us to describe<lb/>
Switzerland as the illustration and example of<lb/>
a truly Federal State. Swiss history, Swiss character,<lb/>
the political and economic structure of the country,<lb/>
its intellectual life, its army, are discussed from this<lb/>
point of view.<lb/>
<space/>The book itself is a product of “Federalism,” for<lb/>
its authors are unlike in almost everything ; one of us<lb/>
was born and bred in Switzerland, the other in the<lb/>
American Far West ; one of us is conservative, the<lb/>
other progressive. We are different in age, experience,<lb/>
and culture, yet our collaboration has been<lb/>
complete, and our work is the result of a union of<lb/>

I. CHALLENGING PARADOXES<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
When you read the newspapers, you find that<lb/>
Switzerland is only a little country which has so far<lb/>
had the good luck not to attract much attention. But<lb/>
when you read history, you find that Switzerland is<lb/>
perhaps the formula for the only possible European<lb/>
future. That is why it seems opportune today to<lb/>
describe this solution to modern problems, which,<lb/>
though on a small scale, has the immense advantage<lb/>
of being actually in existence, and of having survived<lb/>
six and one-half centuries of history.<lb/>
<space/>The following pages set forth a series of observations<lb/>
which have a direct bearing on the urgent problems<lb/>
common to all democracies of today. They are<lb/>
not propaganda, for propaganda is unnecessary between<lb/>
friends, and the good will that unites America<lb/>
and Switzerland is of the most solid and enduring<lb/>
kind. It is founded on a common ideal which the<lb/>
present world crisis can only deepen and render more<lb/>
self-conscious.<lb/>
<space/>Though friendship is born of instinctive sympathy,<lb/>
it develops only through ever-closer knowledge. That<lb/>
is why this book has been written, for a curious<lb/>
anomaly exists in regard to Switzerland in this coun-<lb/>

try ; Americans love it, but for the most part they<lb/>
know nothing about it. They accept it on the faith<lb/>
of publicity slogans as the land of alps and cows, of<lb/>
hotels and fine watches. A few might add that it is<lb/>
a little country lying between Germany and France,<lb/>
an old democracy, and the home of the Red Cross<lb/>
and the League of Nations.<lb/>
<space/>All these things are true enough, but they give no<lb/>
idea of the real country, of its deep and significant<lb/>
organic unity. The Swiss reality is far more complex<lb/>
than Americans in general, or even the Swiss themselves,<lb/>
know.<lb/>
<space/>In examining Switzerland we will describe and<lb/>
comment, but we will refrain as far as possible from<lb/>
political speculation. The history of the twentieth<lb/>
century shows that there is nothing more murderous<lb/>
than political abstractions, and perhaps the time is at<lb/>
hand when men will refuse to be killed for “isms,”<lb/>
for supposedly irreconcilable causes, which are soon<lb/>
revealed as having been accomplices in the slaughter<lb/>
committed in their names.<lb/>
<space/>We will therefore try in this little book to present<lb/>
living facts, not theories nor such dead data as statistics.<lb/>
We will try to show you a propos of Switzerland<lb/>
that contemporary reality can only have significance<lb/>
when seen in the perspective of a long tradition.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland is the oldest democracy in the world,<lb/>
and it is the last one surviving in Europe. The foun<lb/>

dation of the Confederacy dates back to the first of<lb/>
August, 1291. Thus the Swiss State has had 650 years<lb/>
of uninterrupted autonomous life. A glance at the<lb/>
map of Europe shows that it is now the last free state<lb/>
in the midst of that continent. Two other continental<lb/>
states are still nominally independent at this writing:<lb/>
the Swedish monarchy and the Portuguese dictatorship,<lb/>
but they are countries which lie on the borders<lb/>
of Europe, and they have been spared so far largely<lb/>
because they are remote.<lb/>
<space/>The Helvetian Confederation, a strange combination<lb/>
of paradoxes lying at the very heart of Europe,<lb/>
has for centuries incarnated some of the most important<lb/>
lessons, both positive and negative, which democracy<lb/>
must learn today, if it is to survive. These<lb/>
lessons have emerged slowly during the course of a<lb/>
complex history. They have become clear only in the<lb/>
light of the present conflict. This appalling upheaval,<lb/>
this overthrow not only of all our political creations<lb/>
but of our sentimental illusions, was needed to make<lb/>
us begin to see among such ruins the solid ground,<lb/>
the basic structure on which we may hope to rebuild.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland is indeed the most paradoxical of countries,<lb/>
and each of its paradoxes implies a question, the<lb/>
answer to which is of vital importance to every democracy<lb/>
in the world. The mere enumeration of<lb/>
them suggests the challenge which this little country<lb/>
presents to the world of the twentieth century:<lb/>
<space/>First, in its narrow territory—one of the smallest in<lb/>

THE HEART OF EUROPE<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
Europe—Switzerland has concentrated and synthesized<lb/>
all the diversities of Europe itself.<lb/>
<space/>In the central mountain range of the Gothard rise<lb/>
four great rivers: the Rhine, which waters Germany<lb/>
and Holland ; the French Rhone ; the Italian Po ; and,<lb/>
with the Inn, the Danube, which flows through<lb/>
Austria and the Balkans. Thus in the heart of Switzerland<lb/>
the French, the German, and the Mediterranean<lb/>
civilizations meet. Federal laws are published in<lb/>
four languages, German, French, Italian, and Ro-<lb/>
manche, and each of the German cantons, 17 out of<lb/>
the 22 little states which form the Confederation,<lb/>
speaks a different dialect.<lb/>
<space/>If you were to cross Switzerland in the express<lb/>
train from Basel to Locarno you would pass in the<lb/>
course of four hours through all the climates and all<lb/>
the varieties of culture in Europe, from the Nordic<lb/>
pine forests to the orange groves and palm trees of<lb/>
the Italian lakes, through a temperate and densely<lb/>
peopled plateau, and through the desert zone of the<lb/>
Alps.<lb/>
<space/>Is it this very diversity, recognized, cultivated, and<lb/>
harmonized, which has given Switzerland its stability ?<lb/>
<space/>Second, Switzerland is both the most advanced democracy<lb/>
of Europe and the country most deeply attached<lb/>
to tradition.<lb/>
<space/>In the old Catholic regions such as the cantons of<lb/>
Lucerne and Fribourg, an aristocracy of feudal ori<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
gins still rules in fact, though not in law, over the<lb/>
agricultural villages which cluster about’ its castles.<lb/>
<space/>In the small cantons of the central Alpine region<lb/>
the laws are voted and the magistrates elected by the<lb/>
body of the citizens assembled in the public square.<lb/>
<space/>In the larger cities such as Zurich and Geneva<lb/>
a patrician bourgeoisie, liberal and Anglophile, enriched<lb/>
by industry and banking, maintains a social<lb/>
hierarchy as rigid as any in the world (much like<lb/>
that which exists in the Boston of Beacon Street).<lb/>
But equality is absolute as soon as we enter the political<lb/>
domain. Money does not lead to public honors,<lb/>
the magistrates and the bureaucracy are incorruptible,<lb/>
and the son of a peasant has a much better<lb/>
chance of being president of the Confederation than<lb/>
the son of a family whose nobility dates back a thousand<lb/>
years.<lb/>
<space/>Moreover, Switzerland is the only democracy—or,<lb/>
indeed, nation—in the world which has dared to entrust<lb/>
to each man his gun, his ammunition, and all his<lb/>
military equipment in peacetime—a striking proof of<lb/>
the civic maturity of the Swiss, and of the confidence<lb/>
which the State feels in its citizens.<lb/>
<space/>Does Switzerland owe its sturdy progressiveness to<lb/>
the vitality of its age-old traditions ?<lb/>
<space/>Third, Switzerland is at once the most pacific country<lb/>
in Europe and the most highly armed.<lb/>
<space/>Pacific it is, for since the time of the Treaties of<lb/>
Vienna in 1815 its absolute and perpetual neutrality<lb/>
</p>

        <p rend="block big">
has been solemnly recognized by the great powers as<lb/>
being “in the interests of all Europe.” Pacific, because<lb/>
in addition to renouncing all voluntary participation<lb/>
in any armed conflict, it has been the refuge<lb/>
of the military and civilian victims of war, and because<lb/>
it has founded the International Red Cross and<lb/>
the agency for the relief of prisoners, institutions created<lb/>
for the purpose of bringing a little human peace<lb/>
into the organized massacres of our civilization. Lastly<lb/>
it is pacific because by harmonizing in one federation<lb/>
three civilizations, elsewhere at war, two religions traditionally<lb/>
antagonistic, four languages and an unknown<lb/>
number of “races,” it has deserved to be called<lb/>
“a Europe reconciled with itself.”<lb/>
<space/>Yet on the other hand the same Treaty of Vienna<lb/>
which guaranteed to Switzerland its perpetual neutrality<lb/>
laid upon the Confederation the responsibility<lb/>
for defending its neutrality and independence by its<lb/>
own efforts. That is why Switzerland, with a population<lb/>
of four and one-half million inhabitants, keeps<lb/>
up an army of 600,000 men, half of whom have been<lb/>
permanently mobilized since September, 1939.<lb/>
<space/>Nowhere in Europe, not even in Germany, is the<lb/>
military spirit more highly developed than in the<lb/>
Swiss population. Nowhere is the army to a like degree<lb/>
the possession of the whole people. Nowhere else<lb/>
is the citizen so completely fused in the soldier, on<lb/>
the day of danger. Lastly, nowhere else had a preparation<lb/>
for modern warfare and a defensive organiza<lb/>

tion against a Blitzkrieg been so minutely prepared<lb/>
over a period of ten years before the present war.<lb/>
<space/>Does Switzerland owe the peace which it still enjoys<lb/>
to the fact that it is proportionately the bestarmed<lb/>
democracy in the world ?<lb/>
<space/>Fourth, Switzerland is both the seat of almost all<lb/>
the international institutions of Europe and the<lb/>
country the most passionately attached to its local<lb/>
institutions.<lb/>
<space/>How is it that all nations have agreed to locate the<lb/>
site of the League of Nations, of the International<lb/>
Labor Bureau, of the Bank for International Settlements,<lb/>
of the Universal Postal Union and of about<lb/>
ninety other analogous institutions, in Switzerland ?<lb/>
How explain that Switzerland is the most “international”<lb/>
country of Europe, while on the other hand<lb/>
it is here that local spirit is still most active, that<lb/>
the communes have the greatest amount of autonomy,<lb/>
that each canton forms a separate State, with<lb/>
its parliament, its popular assembly, its executive<lb/>
power, its code of laws which differ from those of the<lb/>
neighboring cantons, and its customs, private and<lb/>
public, jealously and resolutely preserved ? How can<lb/>
this almost medieval agglomeration of local, often<lb/>
narrow, particularisms have given birth to some of<lb/>
the most widely European minds of the continent,<lb/>
and to a whole cohort of international negotiators ?<lb/>
<space/>Is it possible that to be deeply rooted in local reali<lb/>

ties is the essential condition which allows a people<lb/>
to look serenely beyond its own frontiers ?<lb/>
<space/>Fifth, the natural resources of Switzerland are very<lb/>
limited, yet the standard of living of its people is one<lb/>
of the highest in Europe.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland has concentrated its activity on the<lb/>
economic pursuits in which it has had the greatest<lb/>
natural advantages, and in those fields it has exhibited<lb/>
an energy and an ingenuity which have made its special<lb/>
national products, chocolate and cheese, locomotives,<lb/>
electrical machinery and watches, synonymous<lb/>
with quality. Though it has no raw materials, Switzerland<lb/>
is proportionally the greatest exporting country<lb/>
in the world.<lb/>
<space/>Inevitably, then, Switzerland has been a part of the<lb/>
larger European and even world economy. It has<lb/>
never flirted with economic nationalism, and it has<lb/>
profited thereby.<lb/>
<space/>Does the success of the Swiss economy constitute a<lb/>
mere memorial to the principles of free trade and<lb/>
specialization, or is it suggestive for the future ?<lb/>
<space/>Sixth, historically Switzerland is the last remnant<lb/>
of medieval Europe, but it may also become the first<lb/>
model of a federal Europe of tomorrow.<lb/>
<space/>In the thirteenth century, the passage of the Goth-<lb/>
ard was opened in the midst of the Alps, in the very<lb/>
spot where the four great European rivers rise. It<lb/>
became at once the main artery of the Holy Roman<lb/>
Empire, for it was the pass which connected those<lb/>

        <p>

</p>
        <p rend="block big">
two separate halves of the Empire, the North and<lb/>
the South. The Swiss were entrusted with its defense<lb/>
in the name of the Emperor, and in the common interest<lb/>
of the neighboring peoples. Such is the origin<lb/>
of the Swiss Confederation. From that time on, the<lb/>
Swiss were a sort of European militia, and their country<lb/>
was recognized as free because it was an “Imperial<lb/>
Domain,” not a feudal state like the others. This<lb/>
special function, this mission, gave Switzerland a sort<lb/>
of extra-territorial status in Europe, from which came<lb/>
the perpetual neutrality later bestowed on the Confederation<lb/>
by the spontaneous agreement of the<lb/>
Powers.<lb/>
<space/>The Holy Roman Empire has disappeared, but the<lb/>
Swiss still mount guard vigilantly over their bastion,<lb/>
which is bottj a vital artery and a symbol. They hold<lb/>
the keys of the vanished Empire. They preserve the<lb/>
idea of a confederated Europe, and practice it within<lb/>
their frontiers. They are still the predestined guardians<lb/>
of the values and institutions common to all the<lb/>
peoples of the continent.<lb/>
<space/>If, as we believe, the Holy Roman Empire was a<lb/>
first incarnation of the federal idea, preserved by the<lb/>
Swiss cantons alone in all our torn and divided western<lb/>
world, and if the only conceivable hope for us<lb/>
lies in a peace where nations will renounce the “divine”<lb/>
right of sovereignty which they have unjustifiably<lb/>
assumed—can we not hope that tomorrow, or<lb/>

day-after-tomorrow, Switzerland may become the first<lb/>
small seed of a federated Europe ?<lb/>
<space/>A seed. The image is appropriate to the size of our<lb/>
country. A seed is always the consummation, the end<lb/>
of an old life ; but if it is fertilized and allowed slowly<lb/>
to mature, it may become the promise of a new one.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland, at present encircled by the Axis powers,<lb/>
is a living refutation, a concrete and indisputable<lb/>
denial, of the totalitarian ideal. The Swiss have never<lb/>
asked for any other “living space” than liberty. By<lb/>
its very existence Switzerland proves that several races<lb/>
can live together in harmony, and on a footing of<lb/>
scrupulous equality ; that it is possible to unite, in a<lb/>
freedom of diversity, various languages, various<lb/>
modes of life, and that this union is far more truly<lb/>
human than the enforced unity of the dictatorships.<lb/>
By its very existence it refutes the racial and nationalistic<lb/>
theories. Lastly, by its very existence Switzerland<lb/>
is a permanent manifesto against totalitarian<lb/>
war, totalitarian arrogance, and the insane superstition<lb/>
of the Kolossal which is at the root of the totalitarian<lb/>
evil.<lb/>
<space/>Although there was a period when it was the strongest<lb/>
military power in Europe, Switzerland has chosen<lb/>
to remain small in order to remain human. It has<lb/>
chosen to remain diverse in order to preserve concrete<lb/>
liberties. It has refused to believe that Man’s<lb/>
reasons for living could be conquered by force, and<lb/>
yet it has been ready to remain at arms in order to<lb/>

defend its own existence “in the interests of all Europe,”<lb/>
according to its particular mission. It owes to<lb/>
its army its continued existence at the present moment.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>This example, this reality, this hope, is worthy of<lb/>
consideration by those who seek to understand the<lb/>
present era.<lb/>
<space/>The conventional picture of Switzerland can be<lb/>
summed up in the well-known line: “The Swiss<lb/>
peasant milks his cow and lives in peace.”<lb/>
<space/>But we do not think that a genuine realism consists<lb/>
in taking only the pettiest aspects of life seriously.<lb/>
If Switzerland can celebrate in this very year<lb/>
the 650th anniversary of its liberties, it must certainly<lb/>
be because it has meant more in the world than<lb/>

prophecy was once guilty of the following line-<lb/>
no less well known than the one quoted above:<lb/>
<space/>“In history Switzerland will have the last word.”<lb/>
We may smile, but we may also wonder whether<lb/>
the reality of Switzerland, which lies between the<lb/>
two extremes of a sordid realism and a millennial vision,<lb/>
does not represent for our century the last conceivable<lb/>
hope of a peace which would not be heavenly,<lb/>
perhaps, but which would be human. This is the<lb/>
question that we will attempt to answer.<lb/>

II. THE FACE OF SWITZERLAND<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
IN order to see the unity of Switzerland we must<lb/>
look at it from a height. On the level of the lakes<lb/>
and fields, the land is enclosed and divided, the horizons<lb/>
are close, shut in by hills or mountain barriers.<lb/>
But if we climb, as in an aeroplane, the country takes<lb/>
shape. The natural depressions become evident, and<lb/>
a long plateau, like the arc of a circle, hollows itself<lb/>
between the dark walls of the Jura and the vast frozen<lb/>
waves which are the parallel chains of the Alps. Rising<lb/>
higher, we see appear, wrapped in a golden haze,<lb/>
the two extremities of this arc, two streaks of pale<lb/>
blue, Lake Leman on the French side and the Lake<lb/>
of Constance on the German. To the north, beyond<lb/>
the ribbon of the Rhine, the Black Forest and the<lb/>
Balloon of the Vosges prolong the undulations of the<lb/>
Jura. To the south on the other side of the Alps the<lb/>
plains of Lombardy fade into a rose and ocher dust.<lb/>
Is that a mirage that we glimpse, or is it the sea ?<lb/>
<space/>Below us, the summits of the two great Alpine<lb/>
ranges, floating above the earth between the deep<lb/>
folds of their transverse valleys, shine serenely brilliant.<lb/>
We are flying over the roof of Europe.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>Almost at the top of the vast semi-circle formed by<lb/>
the corrugations of the Alps, from the Mediterranean<lb/>
to the plains of Austria and Croatia, in the center of<lb/>
Switzerland, the parallel ranges meet and intertwine<lb/>
into a chaotic mass. Four main valleys issue from this<lb/>
mass, down which the four rivers flow, hollowing out<lb/>
in the heart of this granitic turmoil a vast cross, like<lb/>
a symbolic seal. To the north towards the Atlantic go<lb/>
the waters of the Rhine, to the west and the Mediterranean<lb/>
the waters of the Rhone, to the south and the<lb/>
Adriatic the waters of the Ticino, which will become<lb/>
the Po, to the east and the Balkan plains the waters of<lb/>
the Inn, which through the Danube will flow into the<lb/>
Black Sea.<lb/>
<space/>The middle of this cross of rivers is cut by a road<lb/>
which we see climbing up to a remote lake, then going<lb/>
down towards northern Italy. A long train disappears<lb/>
into the mountain, and reappears a moment<lb/>
later, farther on. This is the only spot in the Alps<lb/>
where a single road and a single tunnel join the<lb/>
northern and the southern worlds.<lb/>
<space/>This cross of rivers, this roof of Europe, this master-<lb/>
knot of the Alps and unique passage is the St. Goth-<lb/>
ard. It is one of the most symbolic places in the world,<lb/>
the heart of Switzerland, and also the heart of the<lb/>
continent.<lb/>
<space/>We will leave this mystery for the moment. It is<lb/>
enough to know that it exists, and that, however unaware<lb/>
of it most people may be, like a master-thought<lb/>

it dominates the multiple daily life of this country,<lb/>
with its varied landscapes and history. Let us go back<lb/>
to the life of men. By a typically Swiss contrast we<lb/>
drop from the sublime to the dapper.<lb/>
<space/>In the two days of a circular trip we can visit all<lb/>
of Switzerland, but in that time we will have seen a<lb/>
kind of synopsis of Europe, of its landscapes, its climates,<lb/>
its crops, its customs. Suppose we enter Switzerland<lb/>
by Basel, an old city of the German Renaissance,<lb/>
built on an elbow of the Rhine, whose outlying<lb/>
districts touch Germany on the north and<lb/>
France on the west. We leave the international sleeping<lb/>
car for one of the Swiss “express” trains which<lb/>
stop every half hour—for here everything is close at<lb/>
hand, and each city is a center, and deserves a visit.<lb/>
We must travel third class, like everybody else in<lb/>
the country save officers, commercial travelers and<lb/>
the newly rich. For unless you have the courage to<lb/>
travel on foot, the best way to see a new country is<lb/>
to mix with the movable population of local trains.<lb/>
<space/>The mere examination of our third class coach<lb/>
gives an idea of certain typical Swiss traits. The baggage-rack<lb/>
and benches are of a highly varnished yellow<lb/>
wood, like that of schoolroom desks, and just as<lb/>
in a schoolroom we are warned at once of a certain<lb/>
number of things we are not to do. A sign on every<lb/>
window sill repeats peremptorily: “Nicht hinaus<lb/>
lehnen—Ne pas se pencher au dehors—E pericoloso<lb/>

sporgersi.” No penalty is attached to the rule, as it<lb/>
would be in America, for the authorities trust in the<lb/>
sense of discipline of the Swiss citizen—and it would<lb/>
be unforgivable to disobey in three languages ! Yet,<lb/>
since you are a stranger, let us take advantage of one<lb/>
of the rare moments when the “controller” in his blue<lb/>
uniform is neither coming nor going, to disobey and<lb/>
lean out. You run no risk of a cinder in your eye,<lb/>
for all the trains are electrified and you will breathe<lb/>
the pure air which Rousseau called the “air of liberty,”<lb/>
and which is like the physical soul of the<lb/>
country.<lb/>
<space/>Our fellow travelers are talking of the weather, as<lb/>
people do everywhere, yet not exactly in the same<lb/>
way, for here the conversation is serious. Every Swiss<lb/>
is something of a meteorologist, or at least an experienced<lb/>
connoisseur in the meaning of the clouds and<lb/>
the three kinds of wind which blow in each region.<lb/>
These are the cold, clear northwest wind, the Bise,<lb/>
or the rainy South wind, which is simply called the<lb/>
wind, or the local breeze, whose name is always in<lb/>
dialect—whether it be the Joran, which, falling from<lb/>
the Jura with sudden savagery, scatters and sinks the<lb/>
boats on the lakes, or the Foehn of the Alps, whose<lb/>
hot breath brings storm and avalanche. To talk of the<lb/>
weather is a necessity in a place where everything has<lb/>
to be wrested from a violent, changeable and often<lb/>
hostile nature, which dominates daily life with its<lb/>

the great sources of wealth.<lb/>
<space/>When your neighbors have exhausted the subject<lb/>
of the weather, they will, if they are masculine, fall<lb/>
to talking of their military service. We will hear them<lb/>
on that subject later ; just now they have too much<lb/>
to say, and we to see.<lb/>
<space/>The train is passing through the high valleys of the<lb/>
Jura. Secret valleys, darkened by stern pines massed<lb/>
in regular ranks along the hill-tops. In this austerely<lb/>
romantic setting the villages are prosaic, with their<lb/>
great gray houses of unornamented stone, protected<lb/>
often against the winter wind by a sort of jacket of<lb/>
shingles or tin. There are a few factories, a few farm<lb/>
houses. This is the land of the watchmakers. It is<lb/>
here that Hans Andersen wrote some of his loveliest<lb/>
fairy tales, and here, too, the First International was<lb/>
started.<lb/>
<space/>We pass from one to another of these valleys<lb/>
through deep gorges and frequent tunnels. Here is<lb/>
one longer than the rest from which we issue suddenly<lb/>
into the full sunlight, and blink, dazzled, before<lb/>
a vast space bathed in bright haze. What is that<lb/>
silvery blue mirage which rises full in the sky to the<lb/>
south ? Generally the traveler from abroad rubs his<lb/>
eyes and asks his neighbor if those are really the Alps.<lb/>
It is indeed they. From the Mont Blanc to the Range<lb/>
of the Gothard like a thin line of clouds they stretch<lb/>
in an immense semi-circle between earth and sky. Be<lb/>

tween the slopes of the Jura, down which we are now<lb/>
moving obliquely, and that horizon, stretch the wide<lb/>
undulations of the Swiss plateau, in long parallel lines<lb/>
of black and blue forests, of meadows and woods and<lb/>
wheat fields. We glimpse here and there the top of a<lb/>
steeple or a tower belonging to some city hidden in a<lb/>
hollow.<lb/>
<space/>The impression of immensity given by the landscape<lb/>
results not from its actual size, but from its<lb/>
proportion, its broad architecture, which is reflected<lb/>
in the still waters of a long lake which we are nearing—that<lb/>
of Neuchatel.<lb/>
<space/>Leaving behind us the dark gateway of the Nordic<lb/>
Jura we have changed worlds in a few minutes. At<lb/>
our feet terraced vineyards fall away, and a few slow-<lb/>
moving sails drift birdlike on the unbroken surface<lb/>
of the lake, whose far shores have an almost Tuscan<lb/>
warmth. The vision of the Alps floats on the horizon.<lb/>
<space/>Let us wander on the quays of Neuchatel, this<lb/>
little city built of yellow stone. The scene is animated<lb/>
by the flight of many gulls and pigeons, and<lb/>
the odor of the lake invites to a leisure at once pleasant<lb/>
and melancholy. Here we are at the confines of<lb/>
German romanticism on the one hand and of the<lb/>
easygoing south on the other. There are few passersby<lb/>
in the streets, and those we see are unhurried. On the<lb/>
open terraces of the cafes sit students and young girls<lb/>
who speak every tongue in the world, for Neuchatel<lb/>
is a university town, and it is full of schools. There<lb/>

is a sense of holiday—of having plenty of time. The<lb/>
houses are clean, and the pastry shops fascinating.<lb/>
Many writers, Andre Gide among them, have said<lb/>
that they dreamed of ending their days in this city.<lb/>
<space/>A few kilometers to the east of Neuchatel we cross<lb/>
a river which is the linguistic frontier, and we enter<lb/>
Germanic Switzerland. At once the houses have a different<lb/>
aspect. The large farms of the canton of Berne<lb/>
are undoubtedly the finest in the world. Set in daz-<lb/>
zlingly green valleys—one would think that each blade<lb/>
of grass had been newly varnished that morning-<lb/>
shaded by giant oaks, deeply overhanging eaves spread<lb/>
above long buildings of white stone, half covered with<lb/>
carved woodwork. Along the galleries which surround<lb/>
them, in front of each small-paned window with its<lb/>
lace curtains, bright geraniums glow. The typical<lb/>
farm is divided into three adjoining parts: the peasant’s<lb/>
dwelling, the stable, and the barn. In the sheds<lb/>
you will find old-fashioned wooden carts with ladders,<lb/>
side-by-side with modern American tractors. In the<lb/>
house there are nearly always carved cupboards several<lb/>
hundred years old, a collection of pewter pots<lb/>
and dishes, diplomas of gymnastic or sharp-shooting<lb/>
societies framed and hung on the wall, and also a<lb/>
bathroom and a grand piano. These are “upper middle<lb/>
class” peasants whose like could probably be<lb/>
found only in Scandinavia.<lb/>

the forest becomes a park. Modest little town houses<lb/>
painted green or pink appear, grouped in colonies<lb/>
(Siedlungen) in an open glade or prairie. These are<lb/>
the suburbs of Berne, which is not called the capital,<lb/>
but the “Federal City,” a distinction felt to be important<lb/>
by all Swiss people.<lb/>
<space/>Coming up from the station at Berne, which is<lb/>
filled with skiers or Alpine climbers, you will find<lb/>
yourself at the entrance of one of the most remarkable<lb/>
streets in Europe. The Middle Ages, the German<lb/>
Renaissance, traces of the French eighteenth<lb/>
century in the decoration of its facades combine to<lb/>
form an harmonious and powerful architectural ensemble.<lb/>
The four-story houses are sheltered by projecting<lb/>
eaves and heavily supported by oblique buttresses<lb/>
and low-vaulted arcades. Under the tunnel of<lb/>
the arcades moves a crowd half peasant, half bourgeois.<lb/>
Here, as in the countryside, all the first floor<lb/>
windows are gay with pots of geraniums, and between<lb/>
them, little red cushions, on which the townspeople<lb/>
lean comfortably while they watch the evening spectacle<lb/>
of the street.<lb/>
<space/>It is a broad, paved street, in which a double row<lb/>
of stone slabs still marks the carriage-way, between<lb/>
the tracks of the street cars. The vista is broken by<lb/>
two large square towers painted with frescoes and<lb/>
bearing “surprise” clocks. A golden giant standing<lb/>
under the pointed eaves of the tower moves at noon,<lb/>

while the good Emperor Joseph and his knights come<lb/>
out of a recess, pass by, bowing, and re-enter the wall,<lb/>
to the great joy of the children and their nurses, who<lb/>
wait eagerly for this daily sight. A series of fountains<lb/>
surmounted by statues complete the fantastic yet<lb/>
wonderfully human aspect of this street. These fountains<lb/>
consist of large round basins, in the midst of<lb/>
which rise carved stone columns painted in vivid<lb/>
blue, red and gold. One of these columns carries a<lb/>
banneret1 in armor, another an ogre busily devouring<lb/>
fat little children, a third, blind Justice, and a<lb/>
fourth, a bear with a golden helmet, holding a banner.<lb/>
The bear is the totem of Berne, from which the<lb/>

supplied with carrots and peanuts by a crowd<lb/>

its prey without a single useless move. Watch them<lb/>
catching the carrots which the children throw them.<lb/>
They sit back lazily on their haunches and make only<lb/>
the smallest motions, yet they never miss their aim.<lb/>
The inhabitant of Berne, who knows the pet name<lb/>
of each animal, is always amused by them, always<lb/>
watches them with a kind of pleased respect. He remembers<lb/>
that they are descendants of the bears which<lb/>
a Swiss army captured from the Duke of Milan at<lb/>
the beginning of the sixteenth century, and led back<lb/>
on leashes over the Alps to Berne.<lb/>

university city of the Rhenish type, the eastern plateau<lb/>
of the Jura, Neuchatel and its lake painted with<lb/>
southern shadows, the opulent Bernese countryside<lb/>
and finally the Federal City, built on the crest and<lb/>
slopes of a long hill, and surrounded by a deep loop<lb/>
of the Aar. Three cities, three miniature worlds, more<lb/>
unlike than Boston and San Francisco, yet only one<lb/>
or two hours apart by railroad.<lb/>
<space/>Now we penetrate further into Germanic (the<lb/>
Swiss avoid saying “German” since this war) Switzerland.<lb/>
Again the character of the dwellings changes.<lb/>

sharp-pointed roofs and white-barred windows which<lb/>

which hide the summits of the pre-Alps.<lb/>

among the outposts of the Gothard Range. Its shores<lb/>
are so rich in historic memories that we might think<lb/>
ourselves in an open-air museum. Opposite Lucerne<lb/>
is Triebschen, Wagner’s island, where Nietzsche<lb/>
loved Cosima without ever daring to admit it. On<lb/>
the nearby shore a monument recalls the death of the<lb/>
young Queen Astrid of Belgium. Further on is the<lb/>
villa of William II. Then we enter the region of the<lb/>
“holy places” of the Confederacy ; the battlefield of<lb/>
Sempach, the Chapel built on the spot where legend<lb/>
says that William Tell leaped ashore to escape from<lb/>
the boat of the bailiff Gessler, and the hollow road<lb/>
where he waited to kill Gessler with an arrow from<lb/>
his crossbow. Opposite, on the southern bank, is a<lb/>

by a cement arcade. The valley is narrow and desertic.<lb/>
Not a trace of green. A few ruined houses by the<lb/>

short perfumed summer hay is stored. Here the whole<lb/>
population moves according to the season from the<lb/>
level of the vineyards to the winter homes, then up<lb/>
into the summer pastures, ever struggling with a nature<lb/>
violent and full of contrasts, ever attuned to its<lb/>
rhythms.<lb/>
<space/>While the train slowly crawls diagonally along the<lb/>
north slope of the main valley let us look down towards<lb/>
Brigue, at a high spur of rock topped by a little<lb/>
church and a cemetery. It is Rarogne. Seen from<lb/>
above, the village melts into the rocks which surround<lb/>
it, the pale pink Roman tiles scarcely distinguishable<lb/>
from the fallen granite shale. It is in this<lb/>
lovely cemetery near the old Lords of Rarogne that<lb/>

Rilke chose to be buried. No one understood the<lb/>
Valais better than the poet who spent the last six<lb/>
years of his life a few miles away in a keep built in<lb/>
the twelfth century, the little castle of Muzot ; a tower,<lb/>
a wide portal, a garden of roses and an orchard. No<lb/>
one saw more intensely this grandiose and violent<lb/>
landscape, nor perceived so clearly that it is an Alpine<lb/>
Spain.<lb/>
<space/>Soon after the station of Brigue, which is swept by<lb/>
a hot wind laden with dust and particles of silex, we<lb/>
re-enter the flanks of the mountain. This is the tunnel<lb/>
of the Simplon which crosses the second Alpine<lb/>
chain. Another half hour of darkness—the Simplon is<lb/>
twenty-one miles long—and we come out into Italy.<lb/>
The mountains fall away rapidly, the first palm trees<lb/>
appear around the station. In a few moments, we<lb/>
glimpse the Lombard plain and Lake Maggiore, with<lb/>
the Isola Bella and its baroque gardens overladen<lb/>
with statues—one of the spots in the world most filled<lb/>
with literary associations and the memory of famous<lb/>
passions.<lb/>
<space/>We have crossed Switzerland only in its narrowest<lb/>
dimension. We have seen neither Lake Leman nor<lb/>
Geneva to the west, nor the industrial region of Winterthur,<lb/>
nor Zurich, a modern and dynamic city, nor<lb/>
the orchards and banks of the Lake of Constance,<lb/>

idea of Switzerland “one yet diverse,” according to<lb/>
the classic expression.<lb/>
<space/>The impression which we have constantly had during<lb/>
this trip has been that at each stop we were in the<lb/>
midst of Europe, whether at Basel between France<lb/>
and Germany, at Neuchatel between north and south,<lb/>
at Berne where all styles mingle harmoniously, or on<lb/>
the Simplon or the Lotchberg where the signs on the<lb/>
express train read suggestively: “Calais, Berne, Brindisi,”<lb/>
or “Amsterdam, Zurich, Milan, Belgrade, Constantinople.”<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland has been called the turntable of Europe,<lb/>
but there is a still more vivid symbol of the<lb/>
central position of this country. In a little village at<lb/>
the foot of the Jura, there is a mill called the “Middle<lb/>
of the World” because from its large mill pond<lb/>
two streams flow, the one into the Aar and the Rhine,<lb/>
the other into Lake Geneva and the Rhone. It is the<lb/>
separation of the waters. When Germany declared<lb/>
war in 1914 the excellent but simple-minded miller<lb/>
closed the sluice gate which led to the Rhine, saying:<lb/>
“They shan’t have any water in Germany !”<lb/>
<space/>This is revealing of the Swiss character and attitude.<lb/>
Everywhere in this land men feel that they are<lb/>
in the middle of the world, never that they are in a<lb/>
remote corner. The Frenchman who does not live in<lb/>
Paris will dub himself provincial of his own accord ;<lb/>
he feels that he is living apart from the currents of<lb/>
European civilization physically and spiritually. The<lb/>

Swiss, even the countryman who only sees the international<lb/>
express train pass by his door every day<lb/>
nonetheless is never far from a linguistic or political<lb/>
frontier, and does not forget the existence of Europe<lb/>
and of other nearby peoples. That is perhaps why he<lb/>
travels and expatriates himself so willingly, in spite<lb/>
of his deep love for the spot of land where he spent<lb/>
his youth.<lb/>
<space/>Each city, each village in Switzerland, has kept its<lb/>
personality, the product of its history and geography.<lb/>
The Swiss towns are wedded to their natural locations,<lb/>
whether these be the shore of a lake where the<lb/>
city spreads itself lengthwise, or the point of one<lb/>
which it embraces in its arms, or the slope of a hill<lb/>
which it climbs towards the cathedral and the castle,<lb/>
or a natural circle, as in Geneva, where the town has<lb/>
been organized about a central hill. In America, if<lb/>
you wake up in an hotel and look out the window<lb/>
you will seldom be able to guess where you are ; nature<lb/>
has been suppressed, razed to the ground, and<lb/>
covered by buildings which are everywhere alike. In<lb/>
Switzerland you are enlightened at the first glance by<lb/>
a strip of lake, by the nearby or far-off Alps, by the<lb/>
Germanic or Latin aspects of facades and roofs, by the<lb/>
flowers, by the very window signs. You are located,<lb/>
yet at the same time you feel more than elsewhere that<lb/>
you are on one of the axes of Europe, at the center<lb/>
of a series of equally tempting lines of communication.<lb/>

<space/>A second trait which is common to all the regions<lb/>
of Switzerland is this mixture, this coexistence of all<lb/>
the periods of history with the most daring modernism.<lb/>
From the windows of our train we saw roads<lb/>
not as wide but quite as well built as American superhighways,<lb/>
running through old wooden-roofed<lb/>
bridges, painted and carved. We saw cities like Berne<lb/>
where one can move out from the medieval and renaissance<lb/>

and nineteenth centuries into suburbs which<lb/>
are astonishingly like the most ultra-modern cottage<lb/>
cities of America or Holland, grouped about clean<lb/>
up-to-date factories of the Le Corbusier style.<lb/>
<space/>Finally, a scrutiny of the country from the geographical<lb/>
point of view leads us to a third fundamental<lb/>
fact. Through the defiles, the tunnels, the thresholds<lb/>
of valleys which brought so many changes of<lb/>
scene, we have passed from one compartment into<lb/>
another, from one milieu into a different one, from<lb/>
one community of customs and language into another<lb/>
very unlike.<lb/>

mation of the Swiss people, if we turn to the map we<lb/>
will note that the profile of the earth itself makes all<lb/>
this little country like a beehive. Whether on the plateau<lb/>
… or in the Jura or in the Alps . . . there<lb/>
are breaks, hollows, swellings, valleys and dales, compartments<lb/>
predestined each to have its own small<lb/>
community, just as each cell has its bee and its drop<lb/>
of honey.<lb/>
<space/>“The Swiss land will thus impose on the people<lb/>
who come to build their homes in it a special political<lb/>
and social structure, the federal structure ; a special<lb/>
constitutional principle, federalism.”<lb/>
<space/>Napoleon summed up this idea with one of his<lb/>
lapidary formulas in a speech made on December<lb/>
12, 1802, to the Swiss Delegates in Paris: “Nature,”<lb/>
he said, “has made your State federal. To try to overcome<lb/>
her is not the part of wisdom.”<lb/>
<space/>We will see how Swiss history has in the course of<lb/>
centuries fulfilled the destiny which nature itself prepared,<lb/>
and how upon the foundation of these very<lb/>
natural necessities the Swiss were able to erect their<lb/>
civic liberties.<lb/>

III. A HISTORY OF LIBERTY<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
SWITZERLAND was born on that first day of August,<lb/>
1291, of an Alliance of the “communes” of Uri,<lb/>
Schwytz, and Unterwalden, sworn by their representatives<lb/>
on the meadow of the Riitli. The alliance was<lb/>
recorded in a pact, nobly simple in language, whose<lb/>
importance is equaled only by Magna Carta and by<lb/>
the Declaration of the Rights of Man. But in contrast<lb/>
with the charter of the French Revolution we<lb/>
might call the Pact of 1291 a declaration of the duties<lb/>
of the citizen of a free Federation.<lb/>
<space/>Here are its first and last clauses:<lb/>
“In the Name of God, Amen. WE, the people of<lb/>
Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, considering the evil<lb/>
times that are upon us and the better to protect and<lb/>
defend ourselves, swear upon oath to aid and succor<lb/>
one another mutually with our deeds and counsel,<lb/>
with our strong right arm and earthly goods, with all<lb/>
our might and soul, against each and all who do us<lb/>
hurt and wrong. With one voice do we swear and<lb/>
promise not to tolerate in our valleys the dominion<lb/>

He amongst us who shall be judged blameworthy<lb/>

for the good of all and shall, with God’s help, endure<lb/>

two hundred and ninety one in the beginning<lb/>

<space/>‘‘Shall, with God’s help, endure forever.” This<lb/>
clause has been vital to the development of the Confederation.<lb/>
It is always quoted in Swiss speeches,<lb/>
school books, and political meetings, for it is the one<lb/>
which contains the oath of fidelity. A federation, as<lb/>
the etymology of the word foedus indicates, is precisely<lb/>
a sworn alliance, a reciprocal engagement entered<lb/>
into by equals on the faith of an oath. It is the<lb/>
opposite of a power established by force, the imperial<lb/>
power of a man or a group. The Swiss State stands or<lb/>
falls by the unquestioned faith of the Pact, which has<lb/>
no assigned limits. That is why this Pact of 1291 is<lb/>
still the solemnly revered basis of the Confederation.<lb/>
Even today in many Swiss homes and schoolrooms,<lb/>
pictures which are products of the popular imagination<lb/>
represent the three founders of the Confederation,<lb/>
with their left hands joined and their right<lb/>
hands raised to Heaven. Switzerland was born of that<lb/>
gesture.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>Yet we must beware of over-simplification, which<lb/>
is the fault of text-books. The oath of the three<lb/>
Swiss must be seen in its historic context. This does<lb/>
not detract from the greatness of the deed, but it does<lb/>
explain the conditions and the conflict of interests<lb/>
which made the Confederation possible.<lb/>
<space/>In thirteenth-century Europe the Holy Roman Empire<lb/>
of the German nation loomed large. It was a<lb/>
vast construction which bound loosely together semisovereign<lb/>
states of various kinds: kingdoms, duchies,<lb/>
bishoprics, knight holdings, and free cities. It comprised<lb/>
roughly during that century the greater part<lb/>
of the German-speaking territories of Europe, and<lb/>
also a large part of Italy. But it was undergoing a<lb/>
serious crisis. Torn by the strife of the Guelfs and<lb/>
the Ghibellines (partisans of the Pope and the Emperor) <lb/>
it was threatened on the one hand by the<lb/>
growth of the liberal movement in the communes of<lb/>
northern Italy, Flanders and France, and on the other<lb/>
by the ambitions of powerful feudal houses, which<lb/>
were practicing a kind of reactionary “real-politik”<lb/>
and becoming more and more oppressive to their free<lb/>
subjects. One of the most illustrious of these was the<lb/>
House of Habsburg, whose strongholds were growing<lb/>
in number to the north of the present Switzerland,<lb/>
and whose lands were constantly extending in the<lb/>
region of the Gothard.<lb/>
<space/>The forest Cantons of Uri and Schwytz dreaded the<lb/>
grasp of the Habsburgs. Since the latter were for the<lb/>

moment of the Pope’s party, the “Waldstatten” naturally<lb/>
sought the help of the Emperor. Frederic II saw<lb/>
that it was to his interest to support them. The pass<lb/>
over the Gothard had been opened in the twelfth century,<lb/>
and the road passed first through the Valley of<lb/>
Uri, then through the territory of Schwytz. It was<lb/>
vital to the Emperor that this pass should not fall into<lb/>
Habsburg hands. Therefore his son and Vicar, Henri,<lb/>
granted the Imperial immediacy—that is to say, direct<lb/>
dependence on the Empire and freedom from<lb/>
feudal overlords—to Uri in 1231, and to Schwytz in<lb/>
about 1240.<lb/>
<space/>These communities, long accustomed to govern<lb/>
themselves, and to organize cooperatives (Markge-<lb/>
nossenschaften) for the exploitation of the forests,<lb/>
as the nature of their land required, thus became<lb/>
small rural free states, analogous to the Imperial<lb/>
cities.<lb/>
<space/>As the reactionary policies of the overlords became<lb/>
more marked, the Forest Cantons grew more consciously<lb/>
resolute to be free. The merchants, clerics<lb/>
and muleteers who crossed the Gothard kept the free<lb/>
men of Uri and Schwytz informed as to all that was<lb/>
going on across the Alps, and taught them to contract<lb/>
alliances on the strength of an oath, on the<lb/>
model of the urban communes of Lombardy. The<lb/>
latest of these was the Pact of 1291. It was the only<lb/>
one among hundreds of analogous alliances concluded<lb/>
in Italy and elsewhere which managed to en<lb/>

dure through the centuries and become the basis of<lb/>
a genuine State.<lb/>
<space/>This unique success can be explained by a combination<lb/>
of very complex circumstances. The geographical<lb/>
fact of the Gothard, the social fact of the<lb/>
existence of Markgenossenschaften, the political fact<lb/>
of the struggle of the Habsburgs with the Emperor<lb/>
are the three principal factors which helped to crystallize<lb/>
and to maintain the communal tendency in<lb/>
that precise spot in Europe. In Italy, the communes<lb/>
degenerated into tyrannies, Germany turned more<lb/>
and more towards a “real-politik,” and France was<lb/>
centralized under the influence of its Kings. “The<lb/>
Forest Cantons alone kept the inheritance of the civic<lb/>
liberties of the Middle Ages, and successfully resisted<lb/>
the general evolution of the age towards monarchy.<lb/>
By a tenacious struggle they not only won the democratic<lb/>
right of self-determination, but at last founded<lb/>
the League of the Swiss States. The birth of the Confederation<lb/>
and its successful defense are, then, unique<lb/>
in the annals of the late Middle Ages, and the history<lb/>
of the peasants of western Europe contains few facts<lb/>
as surprising. The problem of Swiss scientific historians<lb/>
will always be that of making this event intelligible.<lb/>
Of the struggle for the democratic and communal<lb/>

liberty by the peasants of western Europe that one<lb/>
alone resulted in a lasting creation, a creation which<lb/>
was later enriched by the addition of urban elements.”<lb/>
1 It is the growth of this first federal nucleus<lb/>
which we must now examine.<lb/>
<space/>The story of William Tell is too familiar to be retold<lb/>
here—after Schiller and some hundred of other-<lb/>
chroniclers and dramatists. The historical existence<lb/>
of that hero of the cross-bow has never been satisfactorily<lb/>
established. Moreover, eloquent though the<lb/>
myth of Tell may be, no individual hero should be<lb/>
allowed to obscure the collective reality of the origins<lb/>
of the Confederation, especially since this less-<lb/>
known reality is highly significant for our own times.<lb/>
To know the true story of these beginnings may<lb/>
warn us against the illusions which abound today<lb/>
among creators of systematic and rationalized plans<lb/>
for the federation of peoples.<lb/>
<space/>The makers of the Pact whence Switzerland was<lb/>
born did not decide to found a new State nor create<lb/>
a new form of government. They united to remain<lb/>
free and to be ready to accomplish the task that the<lb/>
Emperor had given them. It was realistically—driven<lb/>
always by the physical conditions of their country—<lb/>
that they gradually widened their Alliance, which<lb/>
reached the final figure of twenty-two cantons only in<lb/>
1815, that is to say, after five centuries. Uri, Schwytz<lb/>
and Unterwalden first saw the need of incorporating<lb/>

in their Alliance the city of Lucerne, which commanded<lb/>
the approaches of the Gothard, and which<lb/>
had an armed force that was respected by the neighboring<lb/>
feudal lords. Thus a first nucleus of four cantons<lb/>
was formed. This group soon allied itself with<lb/>
the Imperial city of Zurich, then conquered with the<lb/>
help of that city the ‘cantons of Glaris and Zoug and,<lb/>
proceeding to give these valleys their autonomy, it<lb/>
made them allies on a basis of equality. Next they<lb/>
made a pact with the city of Berne, which already<lb/>
had an alliance with Zurich, and was soon to conquer<lb/>
and make into subject provinces the land of Vaud<lb/>
and the Argovian plateau.<lb/>
<space/>Thus to the first League of the Forest Cantons<lb/>
were added during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries<lb/>
three allied groups whose centers were respectively<lb/>
in Appenzell to the north, in Berne to the west,<lb/>
and in the Grisons to the northeast. By the beginning<lb/>
of the sixteenth century the Confederation comprised<lb/>
thirteen sovereign cantons.<lb/>
<space/>It would require many pages merely to enumerate<lb/>
the complicated series of alliances which bound these<lb/>
cantons together. What should particularly be noted<lb/>
is that several cantons belonged to two groups of<lb/>
allies, and that the alliances were not always entirely<lb/>
reciprocal in their obligations. It was as though today<lb/>
two countries should sign a treaty which obliged one<lb/>
contracting party to give active assistance, while the<lb/>
other merely pledged non-aggression. For our pur<lb/>

poses what stands out from the history of those centuries<lb/>
is the pluralistic character of Swiss federalism.<lb/>
It gave to each city or valley its own special role<lb/>
within the general Alliance, and respected the local<lb/>
interests and the particular needs of each. Thus, it<lb/>
favored the freedom of every member of the League,<lb/>
without lessening the needed cohesion of the whole<lb/>
in times of war. It was, in fact, the Swiss cantons<lb/>
which first evolved and practiced, in a way that has<lb/>
never been equaled since, the policy of mutual assistance<lb/>
and collective security.<lb/>
<space/>“The principal and first chapter of all the Alliances<lb/>
and Leagues,” wrote a sixteenth-century chronicler,<lb/>
Josias Simler, “concerns the help which each<lb/>
must give the others against those who would unjustly<lb/>
attack them. When once the injustice has been<lb/>
established the canton involved can call on all the<lb/>
Confederates to succor it . . . each canton is not<lb/>
allied with every other, yet though we have not all<lb/>
the same rights nonetheless if one canton asks two<lb/>
or more allies to come to its help all the cantons assemble—the<lb/>
first called having notified the others.”<lb/>
<space/>What strikes us most today in the history of the<lb/>
old Confederation is the strength of the communal<lb/>
spirit. It was that spirit alone which enabled so informal<lb/>
a political system to function. We have already<lb/>
pointed out that the very nature of the land<lb/>
forced the peasants of the central region to work in<lb/>
groups and render each other mutual aid. The po<lb/>

litical mission which was entrusted to them in exchange<lb/>
for their liberties merely accentuated their<lb/>
need for solidarity ; they had to unite for protection<lb/>
against those without. But within the Federation the<lb/>
communal spirit manifested itself in two characteristic<lb/>
ways: in a struggle against any hegemony within<lb/>
the League and in a mistrust of “great men.”<lb/>
<space/>The idea is abroad today that a federation can only<lb/>
be formed under the aegis of some organizing power.<lb/>
The example of the British Commonwealth of Nations<lb/>
is often quoted in support of this thesis, but that<lb/>
of the Swiss Confederation seems to refute the contention.<lb/>
The Swiss Federation was founded and consolidated<lb/>
precisely through a constant struggle against<lb/>
all efforts at hegemony, whether the attempt came<lb/>
from a city richer than the country districts or from a<lb/>
group of cantons having common interests. Thus the<lb/>
primitive cantons made war on Zurich when that<lb/>
city attempted to take the leadership of the League.<lb/>
<space/>Every time one of the cantons thought that the<lb/>
time had come to impress its own particular policies<lb/>
upon the Federation, it found all the other members<lb/>
spontaneously leagued against it, and each time the<lb/>
final result was a tightening of the Alliance on a basis<lb/>
of real equality, the smaller cantons receiving legal<lb/>
advantages to balance the material advantages of the<lb/>
larger ones.<lb/>
<space/>In the social field this instinctive rejection of all<lb/>
hegemony took from the first the form of a peculiar<lb/>

kind of equalitarianism, which deeply affected and<lb/>
still affects Swiss customs and habits. At that time it<lb/>
was not in the least a question of establishing an abstract<lb/>
equality of citizens before the law, such as was<lb/>
created by the French Revolution. Most Swiss peasants<lb/>
were already “free men,” but the feudal seigneur<lb/>
remained lord of his land, and several cantons possessed.bailiwicks<lb/>
which were really subject states, and<lb/>
which they sometimes harshly oppressed. The equalitarianism<lb/>
of the early Swiss showed itself as an active<lb/>
mistrust of over-advertised personalities, of men who<lb/>
did not sufficiently hide their superiority, or who,<lb/>
taking on the appearance of a Fuhrer, threatened to<lb/>
draw the country into adventures.<lb/>
<space/>This mistrust was the negative side of the vague yet<lb/>
widespread consciousness of a mission which precluded<lb/>
imperialistic or dictatorial aims. The few who<lb/>
did not efface themselves in time, such as the reformer,<lb/>
Zwingli, or the statesman of Zurich, Walde-<lb/>
mann, came to an ill end, the former killed in battle,<lb/>
the latter murdered.<lb/>
<space/>This instinctive reaction of the federated citizens<lb/>
was in a measure wholesome and authentically democratic.<lb/>
It is the kindest explanation of certain unpleasant<lb/>
traits of the modern Swiss character. Inevitably<lb/>
in the course of the centuries, as the sense of a<lb/>
mission lessened, an equalitarianism once vital degenerated<lb/>
little by little into a taste for the mediocre,<lb/>
and an ill will towards those who are “too outstand<lb/>

and expatriate themselves, in order to escape<lb/>
from the dumb, half-conscious persecution of public<lb/>
opinion.<lb/>
<space/>To return to facts, from the twelfth to the thirteenth<lb/>
century the history of Switzerland is that of a<lb/>
long struggle between the cantons and the Habs-<lb/>
burgs. As that dynasty gradually strengthened its hold<lb/>
on the Empire and established an hereditary right to<lb/>
the Imperial crown, it lost ground in its land of origin.<lb/>
A series of Swiss victories, each more astonishing<lb/>
than the other, mark this period.<lb/>
<space/>For instance, at the battle of Morgarten 600 Swiss<lb/>
exterminated a “Panzerdivision” of 11,000 heavily<lb/>
armed knights. It has been recently discovered that<lb/>
the army of the Habsburgs was composed of feudal<lb/>
lords from all countries in Europe. The adherence<lb/>
of these feudal lords to the Habsburg cause can be<lb/>
explained by rumors then current as to the republican<lb/>
and antifeudal organization of the Swiss communes,<lb/>
and their violent desire for independence,<lb/>
which had made the name Swiss almost synonymous<lb/>
with the spirit of revolution. The word “Schwyzer”<lb/>
was used at that time much as we loosely use the terms<lb/>
“bolshevik” or “anarchist” today. Maximilian of Austria<lb/>
called any of his rebellious subjects, whether<lb/>
Croatian or Bohemian, “Swiss.”<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>Later at the battle of Sempach, victory was won<lb/>
for the cantons by one man, Arnold of Winkelried,<lb/>
who threw himself upon the Austrian lances, and<lb/>
gathering them into his own breast, opened a breach<lb/>
in the square.2 But the battle which added most to<lb/>
the Swiss reputation as fighting men was that of St.<lb/>
Jacques sur la Birse, in 1444. Desperately inferior in<lb/>
numbers, the Swiss knew that all they could do was<lb/>
to fight to the death. This they did, and they were<lb/>
killed to the last man ; but they inflicted such losses<lb/>
on the French that the latter had to retire. On the<lb/>
evening of the battle, Louis, riding over the battlefield<lb/>
and seeing the corpses, exclaimed, “I am walking<lb/>
in a field of roses.” ‘‘Smell this one, too !” cried a<lb/>
mortally wounded Swiss, throwing a stone red with<lb/>
his blood at the Duke’s head.<lb/>
<space/>The battle of St. Jacques sur la Birse is an example<lb/>
of defense at all costs which the political and moral<lb/>
authorities of Switzerland have put forward during<lb/>
the present war. It illustrates the motto of the oath<lb/>
in Schiller’s Tell: “Better death than slavery.” The<lb/>
troops mobilized in 1939 have often been reminded<lb/>
of it.<lb/>
<space/>Following the Burgundian wars, during which the<lb/>
Swiss defeated and killed Charles the Bold, the rich-<lb/>

“Confederates, I will open you a path. Take care of my wife and<lb/>
children.” But the Swiss, ever mistrustful of theatrical gestures,<lb/>
have it that he said as he fell, “Who is the pig who pushed me ?”<lb/>
This national joke is very popular.<lb/>

of Nicholas of Flue, of Cardinal Schinner, and of<lb/>
Zwingli. These three characters symbolize each of the<lb/>
three acts of the drama in which the destiny of the<lb/>
Confederation was played out.<lb/>
<space/>Nicholas was born at a time when the Council of<lb/>
Constance was laboring to restore the unity of the<lb/>
Church after the great schisms. He came of a family<lb/>
of free and rich peasants of the Unterwalden. Even<lb/>
in childhood he performed the duties of religion with<lb/>
an almost eccentric scrupulousness. He ate nothing<lb/>
on Fridays and often fasted on other days. His piety<lb/>

came to manhood he entered one of the armed bands<lb/>
which were fighting against Austria, and became<lb/>
Roltmeister, a sort of captain. Disgusted by the futile<lb/>
brutality of the expeditions in which he took part,<lb/>
he retired to his native canton, and became a Justice<lb/>
of the Peace there. One day a flagrant injustice caused<lb/>
him to resign his office. This sort of withdrawal was<lb/>
the pattern of his life.<lb/>
<space/>Yet this captain, this judge, this father—he had ten<lb/>
children—was a kind of man not unusual in the Confederation<lb/>
of that day. He was a solid and sensible<lb/>
citizen, although his intimates felt the long drama of<lb/>
his inner struggle.<lb/>
<space/>Doubtless he had visions, and perhaps he dreamt, as<lb/>
did his century, of a more direct contact with God.<lb/>
At fifty he could no longer resist. His vocation overcame<lb/>
all his doubts and his human bonds. He told<lb/>
his wife of his decision, and she accepted it at the<lb/>
price of an heroic struggle with herself.<lb/>
<space/>Then began the solitude and prayer which he had<lb/>
longed for as the culmination of a life’s evolution.<lb/>
He built a cell and a tiny chapel in the gorges of the<lb/>
Ranft, only an hour from his home. The miracle of<lb/>
his childhood came true—he could do without food !<lb/>
Once a week he went to communion in a nearby village—that<lb/>
was all he ate. Neither the spies set about<lb/>
his cell by the authorities, nor the emissaries of the<lb/>
Bishop ever caught him at fault. The legend of his<lb/>

Ranft. Princes sent envoys to consult him, for his advice<lb/>
became all-powerful with the Swiss. Thus he<lb/>
advised them to be prudent in regard to the Duke of<lb/>
Burgundy, for he saw the dangers into which victory<lb/>
would plunge them. If they made war to grow rich<lb/>
they would learn the price of gold, and their patriarchal<lb/>
union would be lost.<lb/>
<space/>But the temptation was too strong. The Swiss neglected<lb/>
the hermit’s advice, and all his prophecies<lb/>
came true. Victory brought quarrels over the division<lb/>
of spoils. Things went so ill that by i486 fifteen<lb/>
Diets had not succeeded in re-establishing the union.<lb/>
At last a Diet met at Stans. Agreements seemed impossible,<lb/>
and the delegates separated with threats of<lb/>
civil war. This was Nicholas’ hour. During the night<lb/>
the priest of Stans climbed to the Ranft and begged<lb/>
the hermit to make a last effort. No one knows what<lb/>
message Nicholas gave him. What the formal documents<lb/>
testify is that at dawn the priest, returning to<lb/>
Stans, called the delegates together and in secret session<lb/>
gave them Nicholas’ advice. Was it a miracle or<lb/>
the result of some political “combination” of which<lb/>
the hermit suggested the idea ? Probably the influence<lb/>
of Nicholas was enough to quiet men’s spirits, and<lb/>
allow them to make mutual concessions. At all events<lb/>
the Diet proclaimed that if peace and the fate of the<lb/>
Confederation had been saved, it was owing above all<lb/>
to the action of the hermit of the Ranft.<lb/>

ism, poverty, spiritual vision, fidelity to the primitive<lb/>
alliance. The mighty prince of the Church, Matthias<lb/>
Schinner, was in almost every point the exact opposite<lb/>
of the lay hermit. A son of Valaisan peasants, by<lb/>
force of, shrewdness and will he slowly rose to the<lb/>
highest honors, to become a cardinal and a statesman<lb/>
more powerful than the Pope, and a great strategist<lb/>
into the bargain. Cardinal Schinner incarnated the<lb/>
imperialistic temptation against which Nicholas of<lb/>
Flue warned the free cantons. His dream was to consolidate<lb/>
in the midst of Europe a great State comprising<lb/>
Lombardy, Burgundy, and Swabia, and centered<lb/>
in the regions around the Gothard under the domination<lb/>
of the Swiss Confederacy. The military power of<lb/>
the Swiss at that time seemed to justify such an enterprise,<lb/>
but had it succeeded it would have meant the<lb/>
end of the Confederacy, for a powerful State centering<lb/>
in the Gothard would have been a perpetual menace<lb/>
to the neighboring nations which were in process<lb/>
of formation, and especially to France, which Schinner<lb/>
hated. Such a State, involved in all the European<lb/>
struggles for power, would have been obliged to become<lb/>
strong and unified, in order that annexed provinces<lb/>
should not acquire too much influence and civil<lb/>
war result in final dismemberment. Nothing could be<lb/>
more contrary to the federal spirit than such a strong<lb/>
unified power.<lb/>

constitution save the pact of 1291. Its Diet, composed<lb/>
of delegates from the cantonal governments, met<lb/>
spontaneously as need arose in one city or another,<lb/>
and it had no clearly defined powers, although its<lb/>
authority was decisive in certain cases. It was this unsystematic<lb/>
system, habitual and customary, but not<lb/>
legalistic, based on the civic sense of the Confederates<lb/>
rather than on rigid texts—it was, in a word, the<lb/>
spirit of the Helvetian Confederation—which the ambitions<lb/>
symbolized by Cardinal Schinner were imperiling.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>At first he was very successful in leading the Swiss<lb/>
troops into Italy on several lightning expeditions.<lb/>
The Duchy of Milan became virtually a protectorate<lb/>
of the Confederates. Thus they were in a measure<lb/>
arbiters of the fate of the peninsula for which the<lb/>
Emperor and the King of France were struggling. At<lb/>
Novara, in 1513, Louis XII was utterly defeated by<lb/>
them. But at Marignano, in 1515, the Swiss were<lb/>
obliged to abandon the field after two days of a struggle<lb/>
which was gigantic for that era. Their slow and<lb/>
solemn retreat—for, fighting step by step, they carried<lb/>
off all their dead and wounded—was the last great<lb/>
feat of the old Confederation. This bloody twilight<lb/>
of Marignano ended the heroic dream of Schinner, although<lb/>
the military reverse would not alone have sufficed<lb/>
to bring the Swiss back within their former limits.<lb/>
A phenomenon of a different order was about to<lb/>
constrain them from within—the Reformation.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>Modern historians have sometimes accused Zwingli<lb/>
of breaking the military energy of the Confederation,<lb/>
its drive towards the sea, and towards adventure. In<lb/>
our opinion Zwingli and his reforms saved Switzerland<lb/>
and returned it to its primitive destiny.<lb/>
<space/>Zwingli had grown up in the disorder of the period<lb/>
of war, of general corruption, and of feverish ambitions.<lb/>
He had witnessed the results of these practices<lb/>
close at hand, as almoner in the wars of Italy. He<lb/>
was a great humanist, realistic by nature, more of a<lb/>
rationalist than a mystic, a born statesman. All these<lb/>
are characteristics which distinguish him from<lb/>
Luther.<lb/>
<space/>He was first noted for his violent diatribes against<lb/>
the system of mercenaries and the foreign alliances.<lb/>
He liked to quote the warnings of Nicholas of Flue,<lb/>
and he brought the political ideal of the hermit to<lb/>
realization.<lb/>
<space/>He had been abbot of the famous monastery of<lb/>
Einsiedeln, which was a center of humanistic culture.<lb/>
But it was as a priest in Zurich that he began to introduce<lb/>
ecclesiastical reforms analogous to those of<lb/>
Luther. The whole population was behind him, and<lb/>
when the Emperor, uneasy at the growth of the<lb/>
Reformation, sought to attack Zurich with the help<lb/>
of the central cantons, which had remained Catholic,<lb/>
Zwingli was given charge of the defense of the city.<lb/>
His political power grew as his religious work took on<lb/>
wider scope. In his opinion Church and State could<lb/>

not be separated, and the regime which he imposed<lb/>
little by little on the cantons which adopted the<lb/>
Reformation deserves much more than that of Calvin<lb/>
the title of theocracy.<lb/>
<space/>He defeated the Catholic cantons in a series of local<lb/>
wars, and after 1528 he became the most important<lb/>
religious and political leader not only of the Confederation<lb/>
but of all Southern Germany. Unfortunately<lb/>
Luther did not reach an understanding with him at<lb/>
the time of the famous Colloquy of Marburg in 1529,<lb/>
and this disagreement caused the failure of the grandiose<lb/>
plan which the Zurichois had conceived. This<lb/>
plan was a system of alliances among the German and<lb/>
Swiss cities, into which little by little France, Denmark<lb/>
and Venice would have been drawn. Zwingli believed<lb/>
that such a European Confederation would<lb/>
have been able to overthrow the Habsburgs who had<lb/>
taken possession of the Empire. But the Lutheran<lb/>
princes were cold to this idea. In Zurich itself there<lb/>
was a growing opposition to the Reformer. The<lb/>
Catholics had nicknamed him “the Bailiff of all the<lb/>
Confederates.” Berne mistrusted his ambition. At last<lb/>
a Catholic army neared Zurich. The Protestants<lb/>
wanted to negotiate. Zwingli was for war. Half betrayed<lb/>
by his compatriots, he was beaten at Kappel,<lb/>
massacred on the battlefield, and his body drawn,<lb/>
quartered and burned the next day. As he donned his<lb/>
armor on the morning of the battle, he admitted to<lb/>
his wife that he felt the darkest forebodings. His<lb/>

tragic end brought to a close the Shakespearean<lb/>
drama of the Swiss Renaissance.<lb/>
<space/>Weakened by its religious struggles, but assured of<lb/>
its independence by the victories which it had won<lb/>
over the French, the Imperialists, and the Italians, its<lb/>
territory increased in every direction—towards the<lb/>
Rhine, towards Burgundy and Lombardy—Switzerland<lb/>
was to enjoy a long period of peace and creative<lb/>
neutrality. At the congress of Munster in Westphalia<lb/>
in 1648, which ended the 30 Years’ War, it obtained<lb/>
the recognition of this neutrality, and formally separated<lb/>
itself from the Empire. This was merely the<lb/>
recognition of a fact which had existed since the end<lb/>
of the fifteenth century. Germany was definitely orienting<lb/>
itself towards a policy of dynastic power,<lb/>
whereas Switzerland was keeping to the old ideal of<lb/>
its imperial liberties. Rather than a break with the<lb/>
Empire, it was, as historians have pointed out, “a refusal<lb/>
to incorporate itself in a denatured Empire”—<lb/>
an act of fidelity to its eternal mission as guardian of<lb/>
the heart of Europe.<lb/>
<space/>The Reformation ended Switzerland’s period of<lb/>
heroic adventure and expansion, but inaugurated one<lb/>
of spiritual growth. The Confederation was stabilized,<lb/>
it had won the respect of the Powers, and it withdrew<lb/>
into a kind of political isolation. What use<lb/>

long respite from foreign history. Few or no wars or<lb/>
territorial modifications, but a slow and minute work<lb/>
of social organization and cultural ripening were to<lb/>
take place.<lb/>
<space/>As early as the beginning of the sixteenth century<lb/>
the cultural vocation of Switzerland had shown itself<lb/>
in the creation of centers of intellectual activity.<lb/>
Basel with Erasmus attracted the humanistic printers,<lb/>
Zurich with Zwingli was the starting point of the<lb/>
Swiss religious revolt, and Geneva under Calvin was<lb/>
the heart of the international Reformation.<lb/>
<space/>The period between the Reformation and the<lb/>
French Revolution was for Switzerland one of systole,<lb/>
of a contraction of forces, and to some extent<lb/>
of political and social reaction. The central cantons<lb/>
continued to govern themselves by the system of the<lb/>
Landesgemeinde, that is to say, through the election<lb/>
of functionaries and the ratification of laws by vote<lb/>
of all the citizens assembled in a public place. But<lb/>
the cantons whose center was a city of some importance—Zurich,<lb/>
Lucerne, Soleure, Berne, Basel, as well<lb/>
as the allied cities of Neuchatel and Geneva—became<lb/>
oligarchical republics. A certain number of noble or<lb/>
patrician families exercised in them a sort of hereditary<lb/>
power, because they alone or almost alone furnished<lb/>
the representatives in the Small Council,<lb/>
which beside or above the Grand Council of the<lb/>

share in the communal possessions, and they had a<lb/>
voice in the Grand Council, but practically the nobility<lb/>
controlled the destinies of these little cantonal<lb/>
republics.<lb/>
<space/>It is in the nature of hereditary power to degenerate,<lb/>
with too much security, into an ever greater mediocrity.<lb/>
Goethe, traveling in Switzerland at the end<lb/>
of the eighteenth century, wrote in his diary:<lb/>
<space/>“Once the Swiss rid themselves of a tyrant. They<lb/>
thought for a time that they were free, but the fecund<lb/>
sun bred from the corpse of the oppressor a swarm of<lb/>
petty tyrants. Today they repeat to satiety that they<lb/>
freed themselves and have remained free. In reality<lb/>
behind their walls they are slaves, though only to<lb/>
their laws, their customs, and their bourgeois prejudices.”<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>In the small republics of Italy at the beginning of<lb/>
the nineteenth century there was a certain stuffiness of<lb/>
atmosphere, a narrowness of life and outlook. It seems<lb/>
probable that the same limitations, what the French<lb/>
call the odor of the shut-in, existed in the Swiss communities,<lb/>
and that this offended Goethe. His criticism,<lb/>
however, seems exaggerated. Rousseau, who had<lb/>
tasted in France of a tyranny more real than gossip,<lb/>
took refuge in Berne, the most strictly aristocratic of<lb/>
all the cantons, and on crossing the frontier he got<lb/>
out of his carriage and throwing himself on the<lb/>
ground, kissed it, saying: “I greet the soil of liberty !”<lb/>

Rousseau and the socialists and revolutionaries who<lb/>
today seek refuge in the United States, land of capitalistic<lb/>
oligarchy. In comparison with the Europe of<lb/>
absolute monarchies, of the corvee, the gabelle and<lb/>
the lettres de cachet, aristocratic and republican<lb/>
Switzerland had kept a certain spirit of liberty whose<lb/>
importance could be measured at the time of the<lb/>
French Revolution.<lb/>
<space/>We have spoken of political contraction in Switzerland<lb/>
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<lb/>
There was, however, a curious phenomenon, one<lb/>
unexampled in other countries, which acted during<lb/>
this period as a sort of compensation for that contraction—this<lb/>
was foreign military service. The Swiss<lb/>
have often been accused of lacking the spirit of adventure,<lb/>
and it is true that the exiguity of their lands<lb/>
and resources has forbidden them to indulge in much<lb/>
violence of action or imagination, but it should not<lb/>
be forgotten that Switzerland of all countries in the<lb/>
world has exported the largest number of hot-heads.<lb/>
The Confederation was neutral, but the fighting<lb/>
blood of its sons was not as readily cooled as the<lb/>
mind of its politicians. The Diet met the difficulty<lb/>
by allowing officers to raise regiments on their own<lb/>
account and to offer their services to foreign princes.<lb/>
These men were not mercenaries in the technical<lb/>
sense. The nobles who possessed regiments did not<lb/>
rent them to a foreign government, but allied themselves<lb/>
to that government according to a treaty system<lb/>

known as that o£ Capitulations. Often they formed<lb/>
the royal bodyguard. Thus Pfyffer’s regiment saved<lb/>
the life of Charles IX during the retreat from Meaux<lb/>
in 1567, and as a result of this exploit the Pfyffers obtained<lb/>
the privilege of speaking with covered head to<lb/>
the King of France. In the same way the Swiss Guards<lb/>
were the last to protect Louis XVI against the mob<lb/>
on August 10, 1792, and were almost all massacred<lb/>
on the steps of the Tuileries.<lb/>
<space/>The history of the Swiss in the foreign service is<lb/>
associated with that of the most brilliant battles of<lb/>
these centuries, many of which were won through<lb/>
their intervention. Soldiers of the cantons were to be<lb/>
found serving the Kings of France, of Prussia, of England,<lb/>
the States General of Holland, the Realm of<lb/>
Naples, the King of Spain and the Emperor of<lb/>
Austria. They were to be found in the Colonies—it<lb/>
was a regiment from Neuchatel which took the City<lb/>
of Seringapatam for the British East India Company.<lb/>
<space/>At a battle during the war of the Austrian Succession<lb/>
Swiss troops fought on both sides. The men of a<lb/>
regiment from Berne in the service of France recognized<lb/>
with horror blue and yellow uniforms like<lb/>
their own in the English ranks opposite them. They<lb/>
were the colors of the von May family and the colonels<lb/>
of the two regiments were cousins. As a result of<lb/>
this fratricidal battle the Diet decided that when<lb/>
there were Swiss on both sides they should not be<lb/>
obliged to fire.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>It is to the period of foreign service that the well-<lb/>
known saying “No money, no Swiss !” refers. The saying<lb/>
is unjust, for it was not merely for money, which<lb/>
in case of defeat was not always paid, but for glory<lb/>
and because of their military tradition that tens of<lb/>
thousands of Swiss chose to expatriate themselves.<lb/>
<space/>A French prince once said to a Swiss officer who<lb/>
wanted pay for his men, “With the money that we<lb/>
have already given you one could pave a road from<lb/>
Paris to Basel !” The officer replied, “With the blood<lb/>
my men have shed for France one could fill a canal<lb/>
from Basel to Paris.” An old story familiar to all Swiss<lb/>
tells that a Frenchman once reproached a Swiss soldier<lb/>
because he fought for money. “And what do you<lb/>
fight for ?” asked the other. “For honor !” said the<lb/>
Frenchman. “Oh, well, each fights for what he has<lb/>
not got,” returned the Swiss.<lb/>
<space/>It must be admitted that the 750 marshals and generals<lb/>
and the thousands of officers of lower rank that<lb/>
Switzerland gave to the armies of Europe did not all<lb/>
come back empty-handed. Many brought home gold<lb/>
and silver, rare plate, furniture, jewels, arms and<lb/>
other precious reminders of their foreign campaigns.<lb/>
Considerable treasures were thus amassed in Swiss<lb/>
chateaux from generation to generation. Many also<lb/>
brought back patents of nobility or wives who were<lb/>
the daughters of foreign nobles. Thus the Swiss aristocracy<lb/>

was bom of the foreign service and has survived in<lb/>
country districts to this day.<lb/>
<space/>The epic of the foreign service was to end in the<lb/>
memorable retreat from Russia, closing at the Bere-<lb/>
sina in 1813, just as the epic of primitive Switzerland<lb/>
closed three centuries earlier on the plains of Mar-<lb/>
ignano. Decimated by cold and disease, harassed by<lb/>
the Cossacks, the Grand Army marched for weeks<lb/>
across the Russian steppes. The rear guard stopped<lb/>
beside the Beresina to allow the body of the troops<lb/>
to cross the last remaining bridge. As usual the Swiss<lb/>
were ordered to cover the retreat. They spent the<lb/>
night trying to keep warm beside the bivouac fires.<lb/>
<space/>“The hours passed slowly. The snow, noiselessly<lb/>
falling, covered the companies, the squadrons, the<lb/>
batteries. Long before dawn Commander Blattmann<lb/>
and Lieutenant Legler wrapped in their great coats<lb/>
were walking to and fro along the road to Stakow to<lb/>
shake off the torpor of the night. The thought of<lb/>
death passed between them.<lb/>
<space/>“Do you remember,” said Blattmann, “that song<lb/>
that you used to like so much at Glaris ?”<lb/>

Legler began to hum softly.<lb/>
“Our life is the journey of a pilgrim in the night.<lb/>
“Each finds in his furrow his own pursuing grief.”<lb/>
His voice rose, warm and vibrant. A few officers<lb/>
drew near, and soldiers got up to listen to the song<lb/>
which penetrated them to the heart, waking in them<lb/>
the magic of memory. A group gathered, men came<lb/>
from all sides, drawn by the echo of their far-off<lb/>
native land. Hundreds of voices took up the couplets.<lb/>
The song grew, passing over the bivouacs and floating<lb/>
across the white plains.<lb/>

“Brothers, march on to danger.<lb/>

“Sunrise will come.”<lb/>

sing a muffled bass, and a burst of musketry fire<lb/>
crackled to the right. . . .<lb/>

of the regiment stood before the ranks.<lb/>

behind us by the road to Zem. We know that you<lb/>

fight to the last man, not to look to the wounded, and<lb/>
to keep before their eyes the honor of Switzerland.’ ” 3<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss lost eighty per cent of their men, but<lb/>
they accomplished the task which had been entrusted<lb/>
to them. They lived up to the motto which was on<lb/>
every flag, “Honor and fidelity.”<lb/>
<space/>At home, in the meantime, the outbreak of the<lb/>
French Revolution found Switzerland with no unified<lb/>
army, no central power, given over to the intrigues of<lb/>
French agents who stirred the people against the oligarchies.<lb/>
The country was in no shape to resist the<lb/>
invasion of the revolutionary armies. Berne was pillaged<lb/>
and all the silver accumulated in its patrician<lb/>
houses was melted in the Cathedral Square to be<lb/>
made into French money. For several years the Helvetian<lb/>
Republic, “one and indivisible,” highly centralized<lb/>
on the Jacobin model which the French imposed<lb/>
on the Swiss, was the theater of a struggle between<lb/>
the armies of the allies, Prussia, Austria, Russia,<lb/>
and those of the Convention and of Bonaparte.<lb/>
But the dumb yet obstinate resistance of the civilian<lb/>
population, the constant risings in the central valleys,<lb/>
at last won Napoleon’s respect, and made him understand<lb/>
that it was useless to hope to subdue a people<lb/>
whose tradition of liberty was five centuries older<lb/>
than the Revolution. In a speech to the Swiss Delegates<lb/>
to Paris in 1802 he made large concessions to<lb/>

astonishing in the hero of the Jacobins:<lb/>
<space/>“Without the democracies of your little cantons<lb/>
you would have nothing which cannot be found elsewhere ;<lb/>
you would have no particular color. Think<lb/>
how important it is to have characteristic traits ; it is<lb/>
these traits which, by contradicting the idea of resemblance<lb/>
to other states, remove that of confounding<lb/>
you with them, of incorporating you in them.” 4<lb/>
<space/>The treaties of 1814 and 1815, although they were<lb/>
based on opposition to nationalism, did not attempt<lb/>
to dismember Switzerland. On the contrary, they<lb/>
solemnly reasserted that the independence, the inviolability<lb/>
and neutrality of the Confederation were<lb/>
in the true interests of Europe. Swiss neutrality became<lb/>
an essential part of the new system. “The declaration<lb/>
of March 20, 1815,” writes Guglielmo Ferrero,<lb/>
“is the door whereby Switzerland entered the great<lb/>
century of its history, the one in which it was to<lb/>
create the most human order that the world has<lb/>
seen.” 5 This regime, a synthesis of the old liberty-<lb/>
loving yet conservative federalism and of certain principles<lb/>
of the Revolution, took thirty years to evolve.<lb/>

Empire left Switzerland uneasy. The oligarchical regimes<lb/>

attack, and the need for some kind of central power<lb/>
was evident. New cantons, long bound to Switzerland,<lb/>
had now officially entered the Federal Alliance. They<lb/>
were Geneva, Vaud (at last free of the domination<lb/>
of Berne) , Neuchatel, Valais, and the Ticino. While<lb/>
the federation of thirteen cantons had been almost<lb/>
wholly Germanic, that of twenty-two now included<lb/>
French- and Italian-speaking regions important<lb/>
enough to demand equality. All the old problems<lb/>
were again to be solved on a larger scale. From 1815<lb/>
to 1847 there was much political effervescence, sometimes<lb/>
breaking out in riots. Revolutionary ideas<lb/>
gained ground. The “radical” jrarty demanded a<lb/>
single constitution and the extension and codification<lb/>
of popular rights.<lb/>
<space/>The latent struggle became much more serious<lb/>
when in 1847 the Federal Diet decreed the expulsion<lb/>
of the Jesuits, and the Catholic cantons formed a<lb/>
separate League, the Sonderbund, to resist them. The<lb/>
army of the Protestant cantons, led by General Guillaume<lb/>
Henri Dufour, put down in a very brief campaign<lb/>
the forces of the Catholic cantons. “Soldiers,”<lb/>
Dufour had said in his first proclamation to the<lb/>
troops, “we must come out of this war not only victorious<lb/>
but without reproach. Men must say of us<lb/>
that we fought when we had to but that we showed<lb/>
ourselves generous and humane.” Dufour applied<lb/>
these same principles after the victory.<lb/>

compared to the American War of Secession, resulted<lb/>
in a strengthening of the Federal Alliance. The Diet<lb/>
of 1848 was very generous to the vanquished. They<lb/>
were helped to pay their war debt by public subscription,<lb/>
raised for the most part in the Protestant cantons.<lb/>
In fact the contrast between the policies of<lb/>
Switzerland and of the United States after a civil war<lb/>
is striking. The result of the wisdom and tolerance of<lb/>
the Swiss was an atmosphere of internal harmony in<lb/>
which Switzerland was able peacefully to make its first<lb/>
written Constitution. After 500 years the League of<lb/>
the Cantons became a true Federal State with an<lb/>
army, a budget, and a centralized executive power—<lb/>
the Federal Council.<lb/>
<space/>It was only after 1848 that Switzerland became a<lb/>
democracy in the technical meaning of the word, and<lb/>
the long tradition of civic responsibility and of vigorous<lb/>
autonomy which remained in its communes and<lb/>
its cantons, as well as its relative tardiness in assimilating<lb/>
certain of the revolutionary ideas, combined to<lb/>
give the new Confederation exceptional stability.<lb/>
<space/>In 1874 the Constitution was easily adapted to the<lb/>
new necessities created by the economic development<lb/>
of the country. These obviously tended to bring<lb/>
about a growing centralization. Therefore until the<lb/>
present war the crux of all political discussions in<lb/>
Switzerland was the problem of the respective rights<lb/>
of the cantons and the Confederation.<lb/>

mission. A mere citizen, Henry Dunant,<lb/>
founded the International Red Cross ; the Federal<lb/>
Council devoted large sums of money to building<lb/>
the tunnels of the St. Gothard, the Lotchberg and<lb/>
the Simplon, by which the neighboring nations were<lb/>
to profit even more than Switzerland ; and other international<lb/>
institutions chose to fix their central seat<lb/>
in Switzerland. Thus the original function of the<lb/>
country found its modern expression, one that was to<lb/>
reveal itself strikingly during the war of 1914 to 1918.<lb/>
<space/>After a century of growing nationalism, the first<lb/>
world war, which set the German and Latin worlds<lb/>
at odds, was for Switzerland a crucial test of its Federalism.<lb/>
Would not the French and Italian cantons take<lb/>
sides with the Allies and the German cantons with<lb/>
the Central Powers ? This did happen in a sense. For<lb/>
four years a moral gulf existed between the two<lb/>
linguistic groups. It seemed a miracle to outsiders that<lb/>
political passions did not break up the Confederation.<lb/>

than an electoral campaign divides the United States.<lb/>

in sympathy on the part of the High Command, the<lb/>
Swiss Army faithfully watched at the frontiers. Moreover<lb/>

<space/>As in the days of the Reformation, of monarchical<lb/>
absolutism, and of the French Revolution, Switzerland<lb/>
again became the land of refuge for the exiled<lb/>
and the persecuted of all countries. Sienkiewicz, Ro-<lb/>
main Rolland, Lenin found refuge there. But above<lb/>
all, Switzerland became a sort of vast international<lb/>
ambulance. Tens of thousands of prisoners, sick or<lb/>
severely wounded, from both camps were there received<lb/>
and nursed in the summer and winter resorts,<lb/>
now empty of tourists. Hotel of Europe in peacetime,<lb/>
Switzerland became its hospital during the war.<lb/>
<space/>Because of its neutrality and its central position,<lb/>
it was the spot where most of the secret conversations<lb/>
between belligerents took place. It was also, less<lb/>
happily, a center of international espionage. In the<lb/>
castles and homes of the Swiss aristocracy, often related<lb/>
to both sides, unofficial emissaries could meet<lb/>
as it were by accident. In 1917, in a house in Neu-<lb/>
chatel, Prince Sixte de Bourbon Parme tried to negotiate<lb/>
a separate peace for Austria, which was almost<lb/>
realized. At the same time in the cafes of Zurich and<lb/>
Geneva, Lenin was meeting German agents and preparing<lb/>
the famous trip in a sealed railway carriage<lb/>
which was to take him, with the consent of the<lb/>
Kaiser’s government, to Finland.<lb/>

less . . . for sympathy for the Allies or for Germany<lb/>
was evident in the editorials of the Swiss press. In<lb/>
1917, when peace rumors were abroad, the Germans<lb/>
used to say: “The Allies would like to make peace,<lb/>
but the Gazette de Lausanne won’t let them.” Yet on<lb/>
the whole Swiss opinion was remarkably objective<lb/>
and cool.<lb/>
<space/>In the period between the two wars it seemed that<lb/>
Switzerland was to have an opportunity to crown its<lb/>
century-old mission. The League of Nations in deciding<lb/>
to fix its abode in Geneva paid a striking tribute<lb/>
to the super-national part the Confederation had<lb/>
played since the far-off days of the Holy Roman<lb/>
Empire. It seemed that the history of this little country<lb/>
was to find its culmination in the development of<lb/>
a World Federation with its capital in Switzerland.<lb/>
<space/>But once the first enthusiasm was over, the prudent<lb/>
Swiss, who are experts in federalism, saw the weaknesses<lb/>
of an organism which was too theoretically<lb/>
and too hastily constructed, too ill-rooted in the conscience<lb/>
of peoples to offer much guarantee of permanence.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>Cautiously, because of its faith in the continuity<lb/>
of its own history, which it did not think was ended,<lb/>
the Swiss Confederation asked for and obtained a<lb/>
special status in the League. It is partly to this prudence,<lb/>
which many considered exaggerated at the<lb/>
time, that Switzerland owes the fact that it has so far<lb/>
been spared in the second world war. Had the country<lb/>

might by the force of circumstances have become an<lb/>
instrument of British policy, it would perhaps have<lb/>
paid dearly for this deviation from its traditional<lb/>
attitude.<lb/>
<space/>Today Switzerland is reduced to its simplest expression,<lb/>
to its original peril and greatness. Two physical<lb/>
images illustrate both the real position and the significant<lb/>
destiny of the country. In Geneva the Palace<lb/>
of the Nations, finished shortly before the outbreak of<lb/>
war, is empty, and guarded by anti-aircraft guns and<lb/>
soldiers with loaded rifles. On the other hand, around<lb/>
the powerfully fortified Gothard, age-old center of<lb/>
Swiss life, the nine divisions of the Swiss Army, one<lb/>
of the best trained in the world, mount guard day<lb/>
and night, ready to blow up the tunnel and the road,<lb/>
ready to resist the invader with all the resolution of<lb/>
a people which has always known what it has to<lb/>
defend.<lb/>
<space/>A sentence of Alexander Vinet, the nineteenth<lb/>
century Swiss philosopher and theologian, seems to<lb/>
sum up the essential meaning of the history which<lb/>
we have here briefly recalled. This maxim was written<lb/>
in monumental letters on the walls of the central<lb/>
pavilion of the National Exhibition of 1939 in Zurich,<lb/>
and every Swiss citizen who read it understood its<lb/>
concrete historical meaning, both collective and individualistic.<lb/>

IV. A MULTIPLE STATE<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
JaCOB BURCKHARDT said of the Swiss that<lb/>
their State is their masterpiece. In the same vein,<lb/>
Lord Bryce in his book on modern democracies put<lb/>
Switzerland first of all the countries that he studied<lb/>
in the qualities which he considered as criteria of a<lb/>
well-functioning democracy. These are: the intelligence<lb/>
of the average man, the extent to which the<lb/>
educated classes interest themselves in public affairs,<lb/>
and the existence of a sense of national unity and an<lb/>
active public opinion. It is significant that these criteria<lb/>
are social, not political, and Lord Bryce recognized<lb/>
that it is, in fact, the temper of the people<lb/>
quite as much as their constitution which makes any<lb/>
form of government successful.<lb/>
<space/>Until 1848 the Confederation was not a nation—<lb/>
scarcely even a State in the technical sense. It was<lb/>
rather a League of Sovereign States, a kind of miniature<lb/>
League of Nations. Its Diet was not a government<lb/>
but a council of ambassadors, who acted under<lb/>
mandate from the cantonal Governments and had no<lb/>
clear legislative nor executive powers.<lb/>
<space/>Two principal factors induced the cantons of the<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
Confederation to enter into a closer union and form<lb/>
a real Federal State. The first was the pressure of<lb/>
growing nationalism in the neighboring countries.<lb/>
During the war of the Sonderbund, it became clear<lb/>
that unless some stronger bond was established the<lb/>
Confederation would fall apart and its fragments be<lb/>
absorbed by its neighbors. The second factor was an<lb/>
economic one. The industrial revolution, by altering<lb/>
the character of the Swiss economy, made some degree<lb/>
of centralization imperative. Yet the new order was<lb/>
accepted reluctantly, and the revised Constitution of<lb/>
1874, which marked a further step in centralization,<lb/>
was carried only by 1414 Cantons as against 714, and<lb/>
by 340,195 voices in favor over 198,013 voices against.<lb/>
<space/>At first glance the Swiss Federal Constitution seems<lb/>
to be in many respects like that of the United States,<lb/>
on which it was consciously modeled. The Swiss Government,<lb/>
like the American, draws its authority from<lb/>
the cession made to it by the cantons of a part of their<lb/>
absolute sovereignty, and it is stipulated that it has<lb/>
no powers save those expressly named in the Constitution.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss legislature, the National Assembly, consists<lb/>
of two chambers. One, the Council of States,<lb/>
represents the cantons. It has forty-four members, two<lb/>
for each canton. The other, the National Council,<lb/>
represents the population. Every 22,000 Swiss citizens<lb/>
elect a representative to it. The executive power is<lb/>
vested in a body of seven men, the Federal Council.<lb/>

These Councilors are elected by the National Assembly<lb/>
for a period of four years. Each of them holds an<lb/>
administrative portfolio, such as that of Foreign Affairs,<lb/>
or the Interior. They are paid by the Federal<lb/>
State a salary of 35,000 Swiss francs a year (about<lb/>
$7,000). Twice a year the National Assembly elects<lb/>
one of them as Chairman and another as Vice-Chairman.<lb/>
During his term of office this Chairman is called<lb/>
President of the Swiss Confederation. He has no particular<lb/>
privileges save that of presiding at the meetings<lb/>
of the Council and of representing the Confederation<lb/>
on public occasions. In practice this chairmanship,<lb/>
or Presidency, is given to each of the members<lb/>
of the Federal Council in turn. For this reason<lb/>
the average Swiss, although he may know who the<lb/>
members of the Council are, very often has no idea<lb/>
who happens to be President of the Confederation at<lb/>
any given moment.<lb/>
<space/>There is a Federal Tribunal, whose twenty-four<lb/>
members are elected for a term of six years by the<lb/>
National Assembly. In practice they, too, are reelected<lb/>
for as long as they wish to hold office.<lb/>
<space/>Obviously the Swiss Government differs both from<lb/>
that of the United States and from those of other<lb/>
democracies such as France and England. Like the<lb/>
American Government it is non-parliamentarian, that<lb/>
is to say, the Executive power does not depend on,<lb/>
nor is it responsible to, the majority in the Legislature.<lb/>

Council are rejected by the National Assembly the<lb/>
Council does not retire, as does the Cabinet in France<lb/>
or in England. It goes calmly on, revising the measures<lb/>
it proposes according to the will of the National<lb/>
Assembly. In this respect it is like the Government<lb/>
of the United States. But the Swiss Executive, unlike<lb/>
that in the United States, is a council, of which no<lb/>
one member has more authority than the others. It<lb/>
is, moreover, chosen not by the people, but by the<lb/>
Legislature.<lb/>
<space/>In comparing the Constitutions of these two countries<lb/>
a curious anomaly is evident. The Government<lb/>
of Switzerland is not nearly as liberal as that of the<lb/>
United States, but it is far more democratic. Political<lb/>
liberalism in the correct sense of the word means the<lb/>
protection of the rights of the individual by a limitation<lb/>
of the power of the State. The American Constitution-makers,<lb/>
acting on the theories of Montesquieu<lb/>
and other eighteenth-century philosophers,<lb/>
carefully separated the three functions of sovereignty,<lb/>
the legislative, the executive and the judicial, and<lb/>
created a system of checks and balances. The American<lb/>
Constitution contains, moreover, a declaration of<lb/>
rights.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss constitution-makers were less liberal.<lb/>
They created a powerful Legislature, which elects<lb/>
the executive officers (who have, therefore, none of<lb/>
the authority that comes from a popular election) ,<lb/>
and also the judges of the Federal Tribunal. These<lb/>

judges are chosen for a period of years, not for life,<lb/>
as are the members of the Supreme Court of the<lb/>
United States, and the Tribunal itself has no power<lb/>
to declare unconstitutional the laws passed by the<lb/>
National Assembly. That power the Assembly shares<lb/>
only with the people. There is no declaration of<lb/>
rights in the Swiss Constitution, although the right<lb/>
to freedom of conscience is specifically mentioned.<lb/>
So, too, are the rights to freedom of the press, of<lb/>
petition, of association and of protection against judicial<lb/>
abuses. Yet the Constitution itself forbids the<lb/>
creation of bishoprics on Swiss territory without the<lb/>
consent of the State and entirely prohibits the Society<lb/>
of the Jesuits from settling there. These provisions<lb/>
are not liberal.<lb/>
<space/>Thus, constitutionally, the Swiss National Assembly<lb/>
has much more power than the American Congress.<lb/>
But political institutions do not always function<lb/>
as their makers intend. Strong in theory, the National<lb/>
Assembly has been in practice less important than the<lb/>
Federal Council. This executive body, which occupies<lb/>
the place of the President or Prime Minister in<lb/>
other democracies, actually possesses a large measure<lb/>
of stability and power. Bryce says of it: “Legally the<lb/>
servant of the legislature, it exerts in practice almost<lb/>
as much authority as do English, and more than do<lb/>
some French Cabinets. It is a guide as well as an instrument<lb/>
and often suggests as well as drafts measures.”<lb/>

limited in two ways: first, by the initiative and referendum ;<lb/>
second, by the power which the cantons still<lb/>
hold.<lb/>
<space/>William Rappard in his recent work on the Government<lb/>
of Switzerland defines the initiative as: “The<lb/>
right of a given fraction of the electorate to propose<lb/>
an amendment to the fundamental law.” 1 This power<lb/>
may be used directly or indirectly. It is a right that<lb/>
most of the cantons, as well as the Federal State, have<lb/>
written into their Constitutions.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>The referendum is of two kinds: optional and<lb/>
obligatory. The provisions of the Constitution of<lb/>
1874 which are relevant to the optional referendum<lb/>
read: “The Federal Laws are submitted for the approval<lb/>
or rejection of the people, if thirty thousand<lb/>
qualified voters or eight cantons demand that they<lb/>
should be. The same rule applies to Federal ordinances<lb/>
when they are of general importance and not<lb/>
of an urgent character.” In 1921 these provisions<lb/>
were extended to “International treaties concluded<lb/>
for an indefinite period or for more than fifteen<lb/>
years.” Here, too, cantonal rights are safeguarded, for<lb/>
the Constitution can be amended only by the double<lb/>
majority of the electorate and the cantons. The legislative<lb/>
referendum, however, requires only the vote of<lb/>
the people.<lb/>
<space/>Both the initiative and the referendum have been<lb/>
used very frequently in Switzerland since 1848, and<lb/>
particularly since 1900. There have been fifty constitutional<lb/>
referenda proposed, of which thirty-three<lb/>
were accepted ; twenty-five constitutional initiatives,<lb/>
of which six were accepted ; four parliamentary counter-proposals,<lb/>
of which three were accepted, and forty-<lb/>
four legislative referenda, of which fifteen were accepted.<lb/>
In all, 123 referenda and initiatives have been<lb/>
proposed, and fifty-seven accepted since 1848.<lb/>
<space/>These forms of direct democracy have a double use.<lb/>
In the first place they are a powerful check on the<lb/>
legislative bodies. Any law passed by Parliament can<lb/>

be called in question and revoked by the people. The<lb/>
knowledge that the laws may have to run the gauntlet<lb/>
of public opinion makes the legislators cautious. On<lb/>
this subject Rappard says: “It is a well-known fact in<lb/>
Switzerland that the fear of popular repudiation is<lb/>
often a more potent factor in preventing the adoption<lb/>
by Parliament of certain legislative measures than the<lb/>
actual repudiation itself.” 2<lb/>
<space/>In the second place the use of the initiative and<lb/>
referendum is highly educative. Far more than a vote<lb/>
cast once a year for an unknown candidate, it gives<lb/>
the elector a sense of personal responsibility. It<lb/>
obliges him to consider many problems for himself<lb/>
instead of leaving them to his representatives. There<lb/>
has been a tendency of late years in the United States<lb/>
to turn the representative system of government into<lb/>
one of mandates. The sending of telegrams and letters<lb/>
to senators and representatives, the efforts made<lb/>
to determine public opinion by the use of polls and<lb/>
straw votes, and the campaigns undertaken to bring<lb/>
the weight of this opinion to bear upon the legislators<lb/>
are moves in this direction. If government in<lb/>
the future is to be by absolute democracy instead of<lb/>
through representative institutions, if public opinion<lb/>
is to rule directly, the initiative and referendum furnish<lb/>
a method of determining that opinion which is<lb/>
both more accurate and more just than the hit-or-miss<lb/>
methods now employed.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>There are, no doubt, dangers in the initiative and<lb/>
referendum, as there are in plebiscites. In the hands<lb/>
of demagogues acting upon a hot-headed and excitable<lb/>
people they might lead to revolution, or to extremist<lb/>
measures of all kinds. But the Swiss have<lb/>
shown themselves to be highly reasonable in the use<lb/>
of direct democracy, of which they have had a long<lb/>
experience. Frequently several attempts have been<lb/>
required to induce them to accept laws which they<lb/>
have at last adopted with satisfaction and profit. They<lb/>
have always rejected demagogic measures such as the<lb/>
socialistic “right to work” proposed in 1896, and the<lb/>
confiscatory capital levy proposed in 1922. They have<lb/>
also rejected most police measures which tended to<lb/>
limit the freedom of the individual, yet they have<lb/>
shown themselves at the polls to be willing to make<lb/>
great sacrifices for the public good. They have consented<lb/>
to extra taxation and to prolonged military<lb/>
service when these were needed. Under these circumstances,<lb/>
with a population so reasonable and so mature,<lb/>
the use of direct democracy is a valuable check<lb/>
upon the extremists and a barrier against dictatorship.<lb/>
Had a referendum been necessary to alter the<lb/>
Constitution, it is possible that neither Hitler nor<lb/>
Mussolini would have reached power legally, as they<lb/>

called “Sovereign” in the Constitution, have each a<lb/>
constitution of their own. These constitutions must<lb/>
be approved by the Federal Authority, which guarantees<lb/>
them. Three conditions are required for their<lb/>
acceptance. They must: (1) contain no provision contrary<lb/>
to those of the Federal Constitution ; (2) assure<lb/>
the exercise of political rights according to republican<lb/>

(3) have been accepted by, and be susceptible to,<lb/>
amendment at the demand of the absolute majority<lb/>
of the people. It is interesting to note that the wording<lb/>
of the Swiss Constitution implies a difference between<lb/>
representative and democratic governments.<lb/>
<space/>The cantonal governments are at present of two<lb/>
types: the old Landesgemeinde and the representative<lb/>
forms. In the former the body of the voters, that is<lb/>
to say the whole male population over 21 years of<lb/>
age, assembles once a year in the public square to<lb/>
vote in person upon the laws and choose the administrators.<lb/>
They are the only existing instances of J. J.<lb/>
Rousseau’s “Sovereign People.” Only five of these<lb/>
Landesgemeinde still survive, and they are used by<lb/>
less than four per cent of the population. Moreover<lb/>
they are not today the practical governing bodies.<lb/>
The daily business of the State is carried on in these<lb/>
cantons by an elected council and by executive committees.<lb/>
Yet these Landesgemeinde are important as<lb/>
symbols of the age-old Swiss institutions, and they<lb/>
have considerable educational value. Rappard says<lb/>

of them: “From all over Switzerland fathers bring<lb/>
their children to witness the sight, unique in the<lb/>
annals of modern democracy and unequaled as an<lb/>
inspiring lesson of civic freedom and of devotion to<lb/>
the common country.” 3 Jacob Dubs wrote on the<lb/>
same subject: “Here the unity of the country is physically<lb/>
represented,—administration, council, and people,<lb/>
spanned about by a single circle and upborne by<lb/>
a single thought. In this unity all political and social<lb/>
antagonisms are dissolved. . . . The thought of community,<lb/>
of the solidarity of all the interests of the<lb/>
people, of brotherhood under the same fatherland,<lb/>
wins power over the assembled multitude. . . . Orator<lb/>
and hearer lift each other to higher planes. There<lb/>
are moments when a silent awe takes possession of the<lb/>
crowd and the feeling wakes in them that they stand<lb/>
upon holy ground ; that God is near them.”<lb/>
<space/>In the other cantons the government is vested in a<lb/>
Grand Council. These are in many ways the most important<lb/>
bodies in Switzerland, for in them much of<lb/>
the vitality of Swiss political life is to be found. Their<lb/>
members are numerous, no less so in the small cantons<lb/>
than in the large ones. These representatives<lb/>
draw no salary, merely a small compensation for attendance,<lb/>
but such posts are stepping-stones to political<lb/>
life. The executive power is vested in a Council of<lb/>
State, the members of which are elected by the people<lb/>
and administer the affairs of the canton.<lb/>

those on alcohol. The contrary has been the case.<lb/>
With the development of Swiss industry and export<lb/>
trade the Federal Government has come to be much<lb/>
richer than the cantons, whose sources of revenue<lb/>
have tended to diminish. It is the Federal Government<lb/>
which now gives subsidies to the cantons in<lb/>
times of economic stress, to be used for relief. It<lb/>
might be supposed that this would tend to weaken<lb/>
the cantons but on the contrary it is generally agreed<lb/>
that the subsidies given by the Central State have had<lb/>
the contrary effect. This is because the cantons have<lb/>
kept the administration of this relief in their own<lb/>
hands.<lb/>
<space/>The cantons retain the net profit of the Federal<lb/>
alcohol monopoly, although they allow it to be administered<lb/>
by the central Government. The Constitution<lb/>
obliges them to spend one-tenth of this amount<lb/>
in combatting alcoholism, and the cantonal governments<lb/>
have developed much imagination in circumventing<lb/>
this provision. Certain local administrators<lb/>
hit upon a particularly happy solution a few years<lb/>
ago ; they spent the sum collected in spraying the<lb/>
vineyards of the district ! The consumption of light<lb/>
wine, they declared, was the best way of preventing<lb/>
the consumption of brandies and whiskey.<lb/>

to the nearby and familiar administration of his own<lb/>
canton that he turns for most things.<lb/>
<space/>Loyalty to the cantons is an active feeling. Some<lb/>
years ago a Swiss millionaire left his native canton<lb/>
and moved to another, where the income tax was<lb/>
lower. He was frowned upon as unpatriotic quite as<lb/>
Americans would frown upon someone who went to<lb/>
live in Mexico for the same reason. The political<lb/>
parties themselves are to a large extent of cantonal<lb/>
origin and they are organized within the canton. Political<lb/>
issues are often purely local affairs and no nationwide<lb/>
elections such as the Presidential ones in<lb/>
the United States exist. The parties in the Federal<lb/>
Legislature are often more like alliances of cantonal<lb/>
groups than like true national parties. Candidates<lb/>
make use of the program of these national parties,<lb/>
but they do not as a rule depend upon them for support,<lb/>
but rather on their personal record and their<lb/>
cantonal popularity. This is an important fact in<lb/>
political life. The spoils system scarcely exists in<lb/>
Switzerland and the influence of the canton makes<lb/>
individual ability and integrity more important than<lb/>
services to the party. Cantonal politics diminish the<lb/>
anonymity of the single representative, lost in a huge<lb/>
political party, and lessen also the influence of party<lb/>
leaders.<lb/>

souls. There are only four cities which have more<lb/>
than 100,000 inhabitants and but thirty-one in all<lb/>
have more than 10,000. The commune is the citizen’s<lb/>
closest loyalty. It is, in fact, as a member of a commune<lb/>
that he is a citizen. In order to obtain Swiss<lb/>
nationality a foreigner must be accepted into one of<lb/>
these groups. The commune in which a Swiss citizen<lb/>
is born is permanently responsible for him. Even if<lb/>
he lives away from it for forty years, he may still return<lb/>
to it and demand support in sickness or in old<lb/>
age. There are several types of communes, just as<lb/>
there are of cantons. Some of the older ones possess<lb/>
corporate estates ; pastures, woods or buildings. The<lb/>
income from these they use for the benefit of members<lb/>
of the community. In certain towns this corporate<lb/>
estate still gives all the burghers of the commune,<lb/>
that is to say its native-born members, not its residents,<lb/>
their firewood for the winter. Certain of the<lb/>
ancient burgher communes are held together largely<lb/>
by this common property in forests, meadows, or tillable<lb/>
land. Cases, however, are said to occur in which<lb/>
paupers, as to whose birthplace there is some doubt,<lb/>
are pushed to and fro from commune to commune<lb/>
and from canton to canton.<lb/>
<space/>The organization of these communes is not unlike<lb/>
that of certain municipal governments in America. In<lb/>
many small places a town meeting is the principal<lb/>
organ of government, just as were the town meetings<lb/>
in the New England communities. In larger places<lb/>

the chief administrative authority is a communal<lb/>
council which is chosen either by the town meeting<lb/>
or by election.<lb/>
<space/>There is great vitality in the Swiss communes.<lb/>
Some of them are in a measure spontaneous groups,<lb/>
for a commune may divide for some given purpose<lb/>
such as the founding of a new school, or the creating<lb/>
of a new water supply. Sometimes, too, several communes<lb/>
will unite for the sake of acquiring some advantages.<lb/>
In all such cases the communes tax themselves<lb/>
to pay for the expenses incurred. Some towns<lb/>
maintain hospitals and asylums, municipal playgrounds<lb/>
and baths, and the museums in which the<lb/>
Swiss delight to amass fragments of the beloved past<lb/>
and theaters are supported locally. A measure of state<lb/>
socialism exists in the cities in the form of municipal<lb/>
ownership and operation of water-works, street-car<lb/>
lines, gas and electric plants. These are usually very<lb/>
well run and therefore the policy of city or communal<lb/>
ownership is, on the whole, popular. The Swiss communes<lb/>
are among the best governed municipalities<lb/>
in the world.<lb/>
<space/>Two facts are striking in Swiss political life. The<lb/>
first is the before-mentioned absence of outstanding<lb/>
individuals. It is not accidental that no great statesman,<lb/>

smaller than Switzerland, or Benes, leader of one<lb/>
scarcely larger, should be associated with the Confed<lb/>

eration. In that country where the individual has so<lb/>
large a portion of freedom, he holds power only on<lb/>
the strict condition of sharing it. Neither the President<lb/>
of the Confederation nor the Mayor of a city<lb/>
enjoy an independent position.<lb/>
<space/>Second, the State is ever the servant of the citizen,<lb/>
never his master. From the modest employee of the<lb/>
post office, who is always courteous and ready to serve<lb/>
and inform, to the President of the Confederation,<lb/>
who is usually a simple and unassuming person, far<lb/>
easier to meet and talk to than the smallest bureaucrat<lb/>
in an American business, the Swiss in public<lb/>
office is the public’s servant. This is one reason why<lb/>
the State, like the Army, seems to the Swiss citizen to<lb/>
be really his own, to be his creation and his friend.<lb/>
In France the attitude of the average man towards<lb/>
anyone connected with the State is despairing. He<lb/>
knows that to these bureaucrats he is a mere worm,<lb/>
and that his chances of remedying any abuse are nil.<lb/>
The Swiss, on the contrary, feels that he can put<lb/>
things right. The officials are near. They are members,<lb/>
very often, of the same village or town. In<lb/>
any case they are not remote nor inaccessible. He<lb/>
probably knows his representative on the Grand<lb/>
Council. All this makes both government and democracy<lb/>
something very real to him. This is a great advantage,<lb/>
and it is due in part to the physical fact<lb/>
that the communities are small. Life in Switzerland,<lb/>
even in cities like Basel or Geneva, is intimate as<lb/>

compared with that of Paris, New York or London.<lb/>
Public opinion as regards individuals has more force,<lb/>
for the citizens know each other better. Moreover,<lb/>
most of the officials are appointed by the local authorities.<lb/>
In this respect it is interesting to compare Switzerland<lb/>
with France. In the cities of that highly centralized<lb/>
country, the prefect or sub-prefect is a mighty<lb/>
personage. He has a great deal of power, and plays a<lb/>
part in every activity, charitable, social or political.<lb/>
But he is the emissary of the Government in Paris, on<lb/>
which he and the whole hierarchy under him depend.<lb/>
The inhabitants of the community are well aware<lb/>
that he draws his authority from that remote power,<lb/>
which may protect him against them. In Switzerland,<lb/>
on the contrary, the prefect, representative of the<lb/>
Federal State, is a minor character, chiefly occupied<lb/>
with the customs.<lb/>
<space/>In a recent study of Swiss bureaucracy two authors,<lb/>
one German and one American,4 examine the reasons<lb/>
for the success of that hierarchy. They reject<lb/>
both the character of the people and the size of the<lb/>
nation as determining factors, and attribute success<lb/>
solely to organization. This would seem to be an<lb/>
exaggerated attitude, the more so since on an earlier<lb/>
page they admit that “the effectiveness of public<lb/>
opinion in regard to technical matters is limited to<lb/>
small communities.” Both factors—the character of<lb/>

the people and the size of the group—would seem to<lb/>
those who know Switzerland in its concrete reality<lb/>
to be important elements in the good government<lb/>
and administration of the country. The effect of<lb/>
institutions and of character are surely interdependent.<lb/>
It is a question of action and reaction.<lb/>
<space/>There has been a very decided growth of centralization<lb/>
in Switzerland during the last fifty years, just<lb/>
as there has been in America. Apart from the influence<lb/>
of example, particularly that of Imperial Germany<lb/>
after 1870, two principal causes have been at<lb/>
work. The first is economic advantage. Here the<lb/>
story of the Swiss railroads is the most striking illustration.<lb/>
Before the creation of the Federal State, the<lb/>
problem of building a system of railways with no<lb/>
strong central authority to harmonize the wishes and<lb/>
needs of the cantons, or to coerce the recalcitrant,<lb/>
was very difficult. At the time of the first construction<lb/>
in 1852, the Federal Government took no responsibility,<lb/>
financial or administrative, for the railroads,<lb/>
although a strong minority favored at least a supervision<lb/>
by the central power. But when the tunnel of<lb/>
the Gothard was pierced, Germany and Italy, whose<lb/>
financial contribution was necessary, made assumption<lb/>
of responsibility by the Federal Government a<lb/>
condition of their aid. By 1898 opinion had already<lb/>
changed so much that the nationalization of the main<lb/>
lines of the Swiss railways was readily voted.<lb/>

power, internal navigation, and traffic itself, have all<lb/>
passed under Federal control, though not Federal<lb/>
ownership. The banking system was centralized in<lb/>
1907. Of these facts Rappard says: “Technical progress<lb/>
engendered changed economic conditions, which<lb/>
in turn called for state intervention. As state intervention<lb/>
almost necessarily meant Federal intervention,<lb/>
the final result was centralization.”<lb/>
<space/>European wars have also caused Switzerland to<lb/>
increase its unity for the sake of national defense.<lb/>
Though much of the power conferred on the Federal<lb/>
government as a result of the first world war was<lb/>
withdrawn after 1919, some part of it was retained.<lb/>
<space/>In the same way the needs of a modern military<lb/>
machine have tended to centralize the administration<lb/>
of the Army. Here, too, centralization has been<lb/>
relative, and it was resisted, but there has been an<lb/>
undoubted increase in Federal control since 1848.<lb/>
<space/>More serious than these economic or technical<lb/>
factors in the growth of the central power is the<lb/>
increasing demand for State intervention in the social<lb/>
field. The evils of the industrial revolution, insecurity,<lb/>
bad conditions of work, poor housing, and<lb/>
so on, have tended to make the poorer classes feel that<lb/>
State intervention is necessary.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland has been progressive in its labor and<lb/>
social legislation. This has, of course, resulted in a<lb/>
certain amount of paternalism, and in the tendency<lb/>
to look on the State as a plum pudding, or a per<lb/>

increased the scope of federal power. But the cantons<lb/>
have retained much of the administration of these<lb/>
laws in their own hands, and so have limited the<lb/>
centralizing trend of social measures.<lb/>
<space/>There are to some extent two Switzerlands, as the<lb/>
Swiss writer, Seippel, has declared that there are two<lb/>
Frances, divided more or less on confessional lines.<lb/>
The Catholic cantons after the failure of their effort<lb/>
at secession have continued to struggle to preserve<lb/>
as far as possible local autonomy, and to resist the<lb/>
encroachments of the Federal State. Their position<lb/>
may be compared with that of the southern states<lb/>
in America after the Civil War. But in Switzerland<lb/>
the federal idea and attachment to local independence<lb/>
was universal. Therefore the Catholic cantons<lb/>
found support in the “federal,” that is to say, decentralizing<lb/>
policies of the conservative elements in<lb/>
the Protestant cantons.<lb/>
<space/>The Constitution of 1848 and its revised edition<lb/>

that it would be more efficient in promoting the economic<lb/>
interests of the country at home and in the<lb/>
international field.<lb/>
<space/>The struggle of the cantons against centralization<lb/>
is evident in certain provisions of the Constitution<lb/>
itself. Thus, Article 43 carefully stipulates the right<lb/>
of the Swiss citizen to settle in a canton not his own<lb/>
by origin, and Article 44 protects him against the<lb/>
arbitrary action of his own canton. Article 48 gives<lb/>
the Federal government authority to provide for the<lb/>
burial of persons from one canton who have died in<lb/>
another, and Article 53 gives the Federal Government<lb/>
the right to determine places of burial, so that<lb/>
every deceased person may be decently interred. Obviously<lb/>
these and other minor questions were subjects<lb/>
of dispute between the cantons and the Federal<lb/>
State. A series of provisions in Article 64 empowers<lb/>
the Confederation to make laws on various matters<lb/>
connected with commerce, copyright, collection of<lb/>
debts and bankruptcy.<lb/>
<space/>The creation of a Federal State undoubtedly favored<lb/>
the growth of industry. With that growth an<lb/>
urban proletariat, divorced from the soil, developed<lb/>
in the larger cities, and in it socialism acquired considerable<lb/>
strength. Thus Geneva and Lausanne have<lb/>
had at one period a socialistic mayor. But socialism<lb/>
itself in Switzerland has been a foreign importation,<lb/>
and its force has been modified by local influences.<lb/>

many years the two principal ones were the Liberals,<lb/>
who were in fact conservatives, and the Radicals.<lb/>
These two parties came gradually to act more or less<lb/>
together and to dominate the political scene. It is<lb/>
interesting to note, however, that in the twentieth<lb/>
century not only the Socialists but the Catholic Conservatives<lb/>
have taken on increased importance. In<lb/>
1935 these four parties together represented seventy-<lb/>
five per cent of the electorate.<lb/>
<space/>Originally very individualistic, the Radical Party<lb/>
has made many concessions to the social-mindedness<lb/>
of the country and to the growth of socialism. It is<lb/>
still mildly anti-clerical and wholly democratic, but<lb/>
it favors a certain amount of state intervention to<lb/>
modify conditions of labor and improve the state<lb/>
of the country. The Socialist Party, while theoretically<lb/>
Marxian, has put much water in its wine. It is<lb/>
not revolutionary but evolutionary and democratic,<lb/>
therefore it caters to the peasant and the petty bourgeois.<lb/>
It is anti-Fascist, anti-capitalist, but not antimilitaristic.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>The Catholic Party is anti-capitalist and also antisocialist.<lb/>
It has been called theocratic. It advocates<lb/>
Christian co-operation and even a degree of corporatism.<lb/>
Its doctrines and program recall the encyclical<lb/>
Rerum Novarum of Leo XIII (1891).<lb/>

the left and on the right. The Swiss people are undoubtedly<lb/>
satisfied on the whole with their government<lb/>
and their State. The dangers from the outside<lb/>
to which they are exposed and the example of their<lb/>
neighbors have only increased their conviction that<lb/>
their own institutions are better than any others.<lb/>
<space/>An obvious question arises in considering Switzerland.<lb/>
Why has the canton remained relatively vigorous<lb/>
in that country while in the United States of<lb/>
America the corresponding unit, the state, has lost<lb/>
so much vitality ?<lb/>
<space/>Federalism in the sense in which we have used it<lb/>
in this book, that is to say, the survival of local independence<lb/>
within an effective union, has obviously<lb/>
not resulted from the political institutions. The same<lb/>
Constitution, the same political forms in the hands<lb/>
of an undisciplined people might have given quite<lb/>
different results. They might easily have opened the<lb/>
doors to demagogical state control. On the whole the<lb/>
institutions of direct democracy, the initiative and<lb/>
referendum, tend rather to unify the population than<lb/>
to preserve cantonal authority and spirit.<lb/>
<space/>The federal structure of the Swiss State, however,<lb/>
does correspond to the Swiss combination of conservatism<lb/>
and a progressive spirit. It has preserved local<lb/>
customs: language, religion, economic structure and<lb/>
so on, yet it has allowed progressive social and economic<lb/>
policies to develop. The Swiss have under<lb/>

stood that mutual tolerance was mutually beneficial,<lb/>
that diversity is the secret of growth.<lb/>
<space/>Konrad Falke, addressing the students of the University<lb/>
of Geneva in 1918, said: “The centralizing<lb/>
tendency has reached such a degree that now it seems<lb/>
to many that in making freedom secure, freedom itself<lb/>
has been lost . . . the centralizing idea is an<lb/>
idea eminently un-Swiss because it is un-free ; it is the<lb/>
father of imperialism, and the most terrible thing<lb/>
about it is that today the whole world has fallen<lb/>
under its sway.” It is probable, as an authority on<lb/>
Switzerland has pointed out, that if they were alone<lb/>
in the world the Swiss would still be satisfied with a<lb/>
loose league, leaving almost complete sovereignty in<lb/>
the hands of the cantons. The one justification for<lb/>
centralization is that it makes possible the greatest<lb/>
amount of decentralization within the country.<lb/>
<space/>So long as the Federal Government confines its<lb/>
activities to economic measures and to problems involving<lb/>
international action, and leaves political,<lb/>
social and administrative matters in local hands, the<lb/>
principle of Federal liberty is safe-guarded. For instance,<lb/>
the nationalization of the railroads was normal<lb/>
and harmless ; the unification of the penal code<lb/>
was much more debatable.<lb/>
<space/>Democracy is an instrument, a method of securing<lb/>
the freedom and welfare of the people. As such it has<lb/>
great advantages. In the first place it is flexible. Persons<lb/>

resorting to violence. In a successful democracy, the<lb/>
government will be in close contact with the people,<lb/>
who take part in its origin and renewal. Diversity<lb/>
and varied types of life must be tolerated in a democratic<lb/>
State, for the existence of an opposition is essential<lb/>
to it. A testimony to this truth came from the<lb/>
mouth of the German Chancellor, Bruning, at the<lb/>
time when the Nazi Party withdrew in a body from<lb/>
the Reichstag. Someone congratulated him on being<lb/>
rid of so troublesome a faction. “No,” he said, “I<lb/>
prefer to have them in the Chamber. A vigorous<lb/>
opposition is necessary for democratic government.”<lb/>
<space/>Democracies, however, are not always liberal. Majorities<lb/>
may oppress minorities. Vast impersonal governments,<lb/>
remote from the electors whom they supposedly<lb/>
represent, may be the result of the “one man,<lb/>
one vote” system. A socialistic bureaucracy may even<lb/>
be the end-process of democracy in the modern mechanized<lb/>
and materialistic world. That is one reason<lb/>
why the makers of the American Constitution were<lb/>
so careful to safeguard the rights of the individual<lb/>
and to limit the power of the representative bodies<lb/>
themselves.<lb/>
<space/>In Switzerland it is the local groups, the cantons<lb/>
and communes, which safeguard the rights and liberties<lb/>
of the citizens, which secure for them the variety<lb/>
and diversity that give life concrete value. In<lb/>
this way monotony and standardization, which are<lb/>
the curse of our modern monster States, are avoided.<lb/>

Federalism no doubt implies equilibrium and struggle,<lb/>
but that is the characteristic of a wholesome political<lb/>
life. There are no minorities in the totalitarian<lb/>
States ; they are like immense frozen political<lb/>
deserts.<lb/>
<space/>Danger to the liberty of the individual comes today<lb/>
in large part from the very size of the modern State ;<lb/>
in it the central government is so remote that the<lb/>
individual can not make himself felt. In addition,<lb/>
an enormous and anonymous bureaucracy tends to<lb/>
be irresponsible, and the separation of powers does<lb/>
nothing to correct this. The three powers may check<lb/>
each other, but they do not bring the State nearer<lb/>
to the average man, as does federalism. In the cantons<lb/>
and communes the individual does count. He<lb/>
knows and can control in a measure the local government<lb/>
which he has created. Centralized democracy<lb/>
tends to concentrate power and diffuse responsibility,<lb/>
passing the buck becomes a technique. Federalism<lb/>
divides and dilutes power, but it fixes personal<lb/>
responsibility.<lb/>

decentralization do not necessarily imply weakness.<lb/>

XL LEGEND of the Rhone Valley says that while<lb/>
God was making the world, Saint Peter was very<lb/>
troublesome. He followed his Master about criticizing<lb/>
all that He did. Nothing pleased him. One<lb/>
country was too large, one too small, one was too<lb/>
hilly, another too flat. At last the Lord said to him:<lb/>
“Since you don’t like what I have created, take this<lb/>
piece of earth and make a land that is to your taste.”<lb/>
<space/>Eagerly Saint Peter went to work, resolved to make<lb/>
the finest country in the world. He piled up mountains<lb/>
that touched the sky, and dug valleys so deep<lb/>
that they seemed bottomless. In them he put swift<lb/>
torrents whose voices could be heard even on the<lb/>
peaks. Everything was superlative. Proudly he showed<lb/>
this beautiful land to the Lord.<lb/>
<space/>“Humph,” said the Deity, “very nice. But what<lb/>
about man ? How can he grow his crops on those<lb/>
steep rocks, or float his boats down those rushing<lb/>
rivers ?”<lb/>
<space/>Saint Peter was abashed, but he thought awhile.<lb/>
“I will put soil on the rocks and pin it down with<lb/>
pine trees,” he said.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>But the rain fell and the winds blew upon the<lb/>
steep slopes and washed away both soil and pines,<lb/>
leaving only the naked rock. Saint Peter looked ruefully<lb/>
at his handiwork.<lb/>
<space/>“Never mind,’’ said God. “You have made the<lb/>
land but I myself will make the men to live in it<lb/>
and all will be well.”<lb/>
<space/>So He made a man sturdy and long of breath who<lb/>
could climb the mountains without fatigue, a man<lb/>
with a keen eye and a sure foot who would not fall<lb/>
into the precipices, a lean man, able to thrive and<lb/>
be contented with little. To him He gave a faithful<lb/>
heart, so that he would never be happy away from<lb/>
his mountains. He was the Swiss mountaineer.<lb/>
<space/>For most Americans this mountaineer is the typical<lb/>
Swiss, and so, indeed, in some respects he is. Yet<lb/>
other types exist, for there is as much variety among<lb/>
the people of Switzerland as there is in their scenery.<lb/>
<space/>Racially, like all modern Europeans, they are a<lb/>
complex mixture, for the country has been a land<lb/>
of passage and a very ancient site of civilization.<lb/>
From the dawn of pre-history men have inhabited its<lb/>
valleys. Before the bronze age a mysterious race of<lb/>
lake dwellers built their water-kept homes on the<lb/>
shores of the Swiss lakes. Remains of the piles which<lb/>
ten thousand years ago supported these miniature<lb/>
Venices may still be glimpsed sometimes through the<lb/>
still waters of the Leman when the lake is low.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>Caesar found a Celtic people, the Helvetians, settled<lb/>
in the land. Traces of their language are left in<lb/>
place-names ending in a silent “z” or “x,” like<lb/>
Tolochenaz, or Chamonix. Rome conquered and civilized<lb/>
Switzerland, and it became for her a corridor<lb/>
leading to Gaul and to the German frontier. The<lb/>
original Roman milestones still stand in some places<lb/>
beside the modern highway. Along the roads where<lb/>
marched the legions sprang up such cities as Aventi-<lb/>
cum, whose wide ruins surround the little town of<lb/>
Avenches.<lb/>
<space/>In the period of the barbarian invasions a series<lb/>
of Teutonic tribes, Franks, Burgundians, Alemanni,<lb/>
poured over the land, mingling with the Gallo-<lb/>
Roman population. At a later day the Saracens came<lb/>
up through the valleys. Ruins of the towers built<lb/>
against them exist on Lake Geneva and along the<lb/>
Rhone, and they have left signs of their passage in<lb/>
place-names such as that of the Castle of La Sarraz.<lb/>
<space/>Among the Swiss of today some pure Celtic and<lb/>
some definitely Moorish types can be found, but the<lb/>
dominant physical strain, even in French Switzerland,<lb/>
is Germanic. The people resulting from this<lb/>
mixture are not beautiful. They lack the soft-eyed<lb/>
grace of the Italians, the fineness of feature of the<lb/>
French, but they are wholesome. Even in the cities<lb/>
they have kept the aspect of country folk, the women<lb/>
rosy-cheeked and broad-hipped, the men rough-hewn<lb/>
and strong.<lb/>

the Battle of Marignano has shown the typical Swiss<lb/>
pikeman: heavy, bull-necked and thick featured, grim<lb/>
and dogged even in defeat. Something of this power<lb/>
is still to be seen in the peasant of German Switzerland.<lb/>
He is essentially a fighter.<lb/>
<space/>There are as many tongues among the Swiss as<lb/>
there are races. Seventy-one per cent of the population<lb/>
speak German, twenty per cent speak French,<lb/>
six per cent Italian, and one and one-tenth per cent<lb/>
Romanche. Each of the German-speaking cantons<lb/>
has its own dialect. These dialects are thicker and<lb/>
more guttural than the true German and some of<lb/>
them contain strange words interpolated from other<lb/>
languages. For instance, the Bernese word for a watch<lb/>
is “skeloretti” which comes from the French “quelle<lb/>
heure est-il.” The Swiss, however, are very much<lb/>
attached to these dialects and they are used even in<lb/>
society in preference to the German which is taught<lb/>
in the schools. At a fashionable wedding in Basel<lb/>
the host was heard to say to some of his guests: “In<lb/>
my house we speak French or German Swiss—never<lb/>
German.” In the Grisons another language of Latin<lb/>
origin, the Ladin, exists, and in the Valais there is<lb/>
a French dialect which is spoken by the peasants.<lb/>
Switzerland, in short, recalls the tower of Babel.<lb/>

lation is Protestant and forty-one per cent Catholic.<lb/>
The religious and linguistic frontiers do not correspond,<lb/>
however. The French-speaking cantons are<lb/>
in majority Protestant, but a part of Fribourg, Valais<lb/>
and the Bernese Jura are Catholic, and so is the<lb/>
Ticino. Of the German cantons some belong to one<lb/>
and some to the other of the two religions.<lb/>
<space/>The State supports the church to which the majority<lb/>
of the population in each canton belongs, but<lb/>
the minority faith has churches of its own which are<lb/>
tolerated and even encouraged. In some of the Protestant<lb/>
communities the inhabitants make great efforts<lb/>
to help the priests and the Catholic churches, in<lb/>
order that those who come from the neighboring<lb/>
cantons may find their own religion and their own<lb/>
customs. There are a great quantity of sects in Switzerland:<lb/>
Lutherans, Old Catholics, Darbysts, Mormons,<lb/>
and others. But the total number of their adherents<lb/>
is very small, and the population is almost<lb/>
entirely divided into the two major groups.<lb/>
<space/>In addition to these various races, tongues and<lb/>
religions, wide differences of occupation in the several<lb/>
regions have increased the human variety. There<lb/>
is no standardization. What is remarkable is that<lb/>
proximity has not created likeness. On the contrary,<lb/>
the smaller the group the more it tends to affirm its<lb/>
own individual traits. The Swiss are proud of their<lb/>
differences and tell many stories at each other’s expense.<lb/>

one from Berne and one from Lausanne, went out<lb/>
to gather snails. The shrewd and active Genevese<lb/>
brought back twenty, the man from Berne had only<lb/>
ten, but when the Vaudois came along, he had none.<lb/>
“What happened ?” asked the others. “I did catch<lb/>
one,” was the answer, “but he escaped me !”<lb/>
<space/>These differences were once rivalries and hatreds.<lb/>
Genevans, Bernese, Zurichois, Balois, Valaisans, were<lb/>
not always allies. The Vaudois, who today celebrate<lb/>
the Swiss victory over Charles the Bold at Morat, forget<lb/>
that their ancestors fought under the banners of<lb/>
the proud Duke. Valaisans show you spots in the<lb/>
pass called the Pas de L’Ours, the Bear’s Step, where<lb/>
their ancestors put sentinels to watch against the<lb/>
coming of the people of the Bear, and a meadow in<lb/>
the valley where the two races fought is still called<lb/>
the Bloody Pasture. Today racial hatreds are forgotten,<lb/>
but the differences remain.<lb/>
<space/>Many mountain villages can be reached only on<lb/>
mule-back over narrow trails and lie at four or five<lb/>
hours’ distance from the nearest center. Some, older<lb/>
than the cities in the valley, were built by men who<lb/>
took refuge on the heights from the persecutions of<lb/>
the decaying Roman Empire. Yet even in these regions<lb/>
there are few, if any, solitary habitations. The<lb/>

the one hand and of neighborly co-operation on the<lb/>
other are ever present.<lb/>
<space/>In certain parts of the Valais the local spirit is<lb/>
still so strong that people from other cantons are<lb/>
looked on with mistrust as strangers. This narrow<lb/>
provincialism leads to feuds and vendettas of the<lb/>
kind that are to be found in the Kentucky mountains,<lb/>
and the police are powerless to stop them. Not<lb/>
many years ago these feuds were fought out in blood.<lb/>
Even now there are occasional shootings, but as a<lb/>
rule quarrels are less violent. In a small village called<lb/>
Chermignon there are two “musics,” or bands, which<lb/>
play at all the festivities of the neighboring regions.<lb/>
The rule is that each must play the same number<lb/>
of tunes, in order that there may be no jealousy.<lb/>
When a few years ago one band exceeded its quota<lb/>
a riot followed and the offending “music” ended by<lb/>
barricading itself in a house and defiantly playing<lb/>
all night.<lb/>
<space/>Like most mountaineers, the men of these remote<lb/>
regions are superstitious. They live too close to nature,<lb/>
with its caprices and dangers, not to feel the<lb/>
mystery of life. The writer, C. F. Ramuz, whom we<lb/>
have already quoted, has painted in La Grande Peur<lb/>
dans la Montague a remarkable picture of peasant<lb/>
life in the high mountains. A Greek sense of ineluctable<lb/>
destiny, of the strength of blind forces,<lb/>
finds expression in this work.<lb/>

the milder regions of lakes and plateaux. The<lb/>
Vaudois, for instance, is an easy-going fellow, fond of<lb/>
good living, and especially of the white wine which<lb/>
grows on the terraced slopes of his country. Cellar<lb/>
parties, in which wines of every year and vintage are<lb/>
tasted, are his favorite pastime. Though reputed slow<lb/>
and heavy, he has a wit which is half naivete, half<lb/>
shrewdness. A Vaudois who visited the tomb of Napoleon<lb/>
and looked at the massive sarcophagus of<lb/>
black marble under which lie the Imperial ashes, remarked:<lb/>
“Poor Napoleon ! He did so like to come<lb/>
and go !” A truly Swiss resume of the Napoleonic<lb/>
epic. Upon this easy-going nature Calvinism was<lb/>
grafted, and the Vaudois is uneasily aware of the<lb/>
Divinity, who is a jealous God. A peasant from La-<lb/>
vaux, visiting his ruined vineyards after a hailstorm,<lb/>

exclaimed angrily, “but this is disgusting !”<lb/>
<space/>The German Swiss have a different type of humor.<lb/>
They love to play practical jokes and to abuse each<lb/>
other. The favorite accusation is theft—probably because<lb/>
the Swiss are extremely honest and there is<lb/>
very little thievery in the country. In passing from<lb/>
one canton to another, it is said, the locomotive engineer<lb/>

of life and a jealous spirit of equality are<lb/>
among them. They are the old civic tradition of<lb/>
the cantons. The Swiss Government bestows no honors<lb/>
or decorations upon its citizens and does not<lb/>
allow those who serve it to accept them from other<lb/>
countries. Swiss families which have titles never use<lb/>
them when they are at home.<lb/>
<space/>The contrast between rich and poor, the gulf between<lb/>
classes, is less evident in Switzerland than in<lb/>
other countries. It has been said that it is the worst<lb/>
place in the world in which to be rich and the best<lb/>
in which to be poor. This is partly because the social-<lb/>
minded communities do much for the needy and for<lb/>
the public at large, but also because wealth is widely<lb/>
distributed. There are relatively few large fortunes<lb/>
and also few desperately poor people in the country.<lb/>
Except in the larger cities the difference in the way<lb/>
of life between the middle and the lower classes is<lb/>
not marked. Many professional people, many good<lb/>
old families live more frugally than the rich peasants<lb/>
of Vaud or Berne. For instance, a lady who is halfowner<lb/>

one which has belonged to her family for two<lb/>

they may not even include pewter or earthenware<lb/>
dishes, yet the people have something of their own:<lb/>
a chalet, a bit of pastureland, a few cows. They own<lb/>
property, be it ever so little, and they do not feel<lb/>
“poor,” for they have security and an established<lb/>
place in the community.<lb/>
<space/>There is a deliberate effort on the part of the rich<lb/>
and powerful not to be different from others. Not<lb/>
only does everybody travel third class in the trains,<lb/>
but the modest bicycle is very popular. There is one<lb/>
for every fifth inhabitant in Geneva. It is not considered<lb/>
good taste to make a show of luxury, and women<lb/>
of the best society dress so simply that they look like<lb/>
superior governesses. Strangers are often amazed to<lb/>
find that the shabby man whom they met in a railway<lb/>
carriage or saw plodding along a country road is a<lb/>
rich banker or landowner.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss mistrust too great courtesy and charm<lb/>
of manner. What the French call “la bonne grace”—<lb/>
graciousness—seems to them insincere. They greatly<lb/>
value frankness—which often means an inclination to<lb/>
tell unpleasant truths bluntly. The highest praise<lb/>
that they can bestow is to say of someone that he or<lb/>
she is “so simple.”<lb/>
<space/>The treasures of delicate porcelain and heavy old<lb/>
silver which many Swiss homes contain are never<lb/>
displayed ; they are tucked away in a top cupboard<lb/>

the occasion of family celebrations. In a modest house<lb/>

near Lake Leman there was a remarkable collection<lb/>
of Persian miniatures, brought back from abroad by<lb/>
an ancestor who served the British East India Company.<lb/>
The family was well aware of their value and<lb/>
interest, yet they were not kept in the parlor, but<lb/>
hung on the walls of the upstairs bedrooms. To have<lb/>
exhibited them would have been considered pretentious—a<lb/>
heinous offense in Swiss eyes.<lb/>
<space/>There is more parade of luxury in semi-interna-<lb/>
tional cities like Geneva, Zurich or Basel, yet even<lb/>
there wealth has a certain secrecy. For example, the<lb/>
houses of the old Geneva aristocracy, on the steep<lb/>
and narrow Rue des Granges, have starkly plain<lb/>
facades that give no hint of the sumptuous abodes<lb/>
within.<lb/>
<space/>These austere facades, hiding a richness and variety<lb/>
of life rigorously kept for an inner circle of friends<lb/>
and relatives, are symbolic of Swiss character, of its<lb/>
self-sufficiency, its mistrust of pretentious semblance,<lb/>
its dignity—and also its narrowness. They explain<lb/>
why Americans know so little of the real Switzerland,<lb/>
why tourists as a rule see only Alps and hotels and<lb/>
often fail to discover that the Swiss are anything<lb/>
more than guides and hotel-keepers.<lb/>
<space/>Another Swiss trait is the remarkable mixture of<lb/>
a progressive spirit with prudent conservatism and a<lb/>
deep respect for tradition. The Swiss citizen is a man<lb/>
of good sense, he is highly practical, and is eager to<lb/>

profit by all new things which are useful. He is,<lb/>
therefore, adaptable and can change with the times.<lb/>
He has in many respects adjusted himself much better<lb/>
to modern conditions than his quicker-witted<lb/>
Latin neighbors. Like the American, he has a great<lb/>
interest in science, particularly in its practical results.<lb/>
The Swiss are excellent engineers—they built<lb/>
spiral tunnels long before these were known in America ;<lb/>
they are fond of machinery and excel at making<lb/>
it. They have studied the scientific aspects of their<lb/>
country, its geography, geology, and fauna with keen<lb/>
interest and have a great faculty of observation. They<lb/>
are always ready to try new inventions, new methods.<lb/>
<space/>Many practical and scientific tendencies are evident<lb/>
in Swiss daily life. Modern methods of hygiene<lb/>
were in use in Switzerland before they became popular<lb/>
elsewhere. Sun-bathing is widely practiced and<lb/>
a characteristic sight is that of day laborers in summer<lb/>
stripped to the waist, their torsos as brown as<lb/>
chocolate.<lb/>
<space/>Swiss clinics and sanitoria are renowned for the<lb/>
excellent care given in them, and people come from<lb/>
all parts of the world to consult certain famous Swiss<lb/>
doctors. Such were the psychiatrist, Jung, the gynecologist,<lb/>
Muret, and many others, including that great<lb/>
surgeon, the late Cesar Roux. The latter was what<lb/>
is called a “character,” and a very Swiss one. He was<lb/>
of peasant origin and his students still speak with<lb/>
admiration of his flow of similies and illustrations<lb/>

drawn directly from nature. He was almost as well<lb/>
known for his willful simplicity and his fierce disinterestedness<lb/>
as for his astonishing skill. He disapproved<lb/>
of fee-splitting and he had his own method<lb/>
of dealing with it. When foreign doctors would call<lb/>
him in to a consultation in Paris, Berlin or Rome,<lb/>
expecting to share a large honorarium, he would<lb/>
calmly charge the patient five francs and a third-class<lb/>
return trip ticket to Lausanne. It is told of him that<lb/>
a Duchess came to consult him and was bidden to<lb/>
take a chair and wait with the other patients. When<lb/>
she tried to make Doctor Roux understand that she<lb/>
was, after all, the Duchess of Blank he coolly rejoined,<lb/>
“Very well, Madame. In that case, take two chairs.”<lb/>
Whether the story is true or not, its democratic bluntness<lb/>
delights the Swiss.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland is the country of out-of-doors and of<lb/>
health, par excellence. Its cities are small enough to<lb/>
make the country, the lakes and mountains, always<lb/>
accessible. The Swiss use their land to the utmost<lb/>
for pleasure as well as for profit. They have made it<lb/>
a playground not only for Europe but for themselves.<lb/>
That is one of their permanent sources of contentment.<lb/>
There is no village, however tiny, on any Swiss<lb/>
lake which has not its beach, and cities such as Lausanne,<lb/>
Geneva and Zurich have several elaborate<lb/>
bathing establishments. In summer the lakes are dotted<lb/>
with sails, for nearly every inhabitant has a boat<lb/>
of sorts in which to idle and dream—or fish. Local<lb/>

regattas are great events in the holidays, and the Swiss<lb/>
were long the champions of the world in the sport<lb/>
of sailing a boat.<lb/>
<space/>They are an active people who prefer to scramble<lb/>
over their country rather than to ride through it,<lb/>
and the seemingly wild and lonely mountain regions<lb/>
are full of alpinists in summer and skiers in winter.<lb/>
Summer chalets are tucked away at the foot of glaciers<lb/>
and peaks, for in spite of their love of economy<lb/>
most comfortably-off Swiss people prefer to spend<lb/>
their vacations in their own country rather than in<lb/>
nearby France or Italy, where life is two or three<lb/>
times cheaper.<lb/>
<space/>Every Saturday and holiday, vast crowds of men<lb/>
and women, knapsack on back and alpenstock in<lb/>
hand, pile into the trains, intent on climbing. Children<lb/>
so young that they have to be helped and old<lb/>
people whom one would expect to find sitting by the<lb/>
fire go along. The sturdiness of Swiss legs and the<lb/>
length of Swiss breath are remarkable at every time<lb/>
of life.<lb/>
<space/>Alpinism has become the profession of one group<lb/>
of people, the guides. These men exhibit some of<lb/>
the most characteristic Swiss traits. Thanks to their<lb/>
skill the mountains have become for them a means<lb/>
of livelihood. To exploit this resource, however, they<lb/>
need endurance, sobriety and judgment, as well as<lb/>
courage and integrity. Many are the true stories of<lb/>

guides who have died rather than leave their<lb/>
“monsieur.”<lb/>
<space/>The keen enjoyment of their own land and its<lb/>
pleasures which is so widespread in Switzerland is an<lb/>
important fact. It has helped to create the independence<lb/>
and contentment with little which are vital factors<lb/>
in Swiss economy.<lb/>
<space/>Another progressive Swiss trait is cleanliness. It is<lb/>
amusing when one crosses the frontier from France<lb/>
to see how regularly on one side the beds will be<lb/>
good and the foods delicious but dirt will be accepted<lb/>
as an inevitable though regrettable fact, whereas in<lb/>
the first Swiss village across the line the beds will be<lb/>
hard and the food simple and monotonous, but<lb/>
every sanitary arrangement will be impeccable.<lb/>
<space/>Love of order is innate in most Swiss people and<lb/>
it may be carried almost to the length of regimentation.<lb/>
In the great white boats, like huge swans,<lb/>
which ply about the lake of Geneva, Entrance and<lb/>
Exit are plainly marked in front of the ticket office,<lb/>
but when crowds of French people get on at Evian<lb/>
a certain number usually rush hopefully to the Exit,<lb/>
expecting to squeeze in and save half a minute. The<lb/>
big, good-natured Swiss guard always stops them<lb/>
firmly, and he has been heard to say in tones of<lb/>
mild remonstrance: “Go in by the Entrance. No disorder<lb/>
here. You’re in Switzerland now.”<lb/>

plied with a certain amount of modern equipment.<lb/>
In prosperous districts the peasants would not buy a<lb/>
house without central heating and electric lights.<lb/>
Owing to the abundant supply of water power, electricity<lb/>
is cheap. Not only are ninety-nine per cent<lb/>
of Swiss houses equipped with it but even in the remoter<lb/>
and poorer districts it is often used for cooking.<lb/>
<space/>We have noted how often old buildings are still<lb/>
in use. The castle becomes the Town Hall or the<lb/>
Arsenal, the old arcades shelter shops and homes. In<lb/>
Geneva the walls of Gondebaud, King of the first<lb/>
Burgundian dynasty, so whitewashed and scrubbed<lb/>
that they have lost all look of age, fit snugly into<lb/>
more recent constructions and serve to buttress a<lb/>
public square. Sometimes extreme cleanliness gives a<lb/>
slightly theatrical look to these relics of the past.<lb/>
Tourists who visit Morat, where all the ramparts<lb/>
with their towers and gates are intact, have been<lb/>
known to doubt whether these were real or only a<lb/>
stage setting, and Chillon and the dungeon of Bonni-<lb/>
var have become so spic and span that Americans<lb/>
sometimes declare that if only the cuisine had been<lb/>
adequate the prisoner would have had little cause<lb/>
for complaint.<lb/>
<space/>These are visible forms of a progressive civilization,<lb/>
but others are equally important. Among them<lb/>
is education. Political federalism implies a large number<lb/>

name, implies a strong interest in education. The<lb/>
Swiss are called a nation of hotel-keepers, but their<lb/>
success in this profession, which after all employs<lb/>
only a limited number of people, scarcely justifies<lb/>
such a rash generalization. It would be more accurate<lb/>
to say that every Swiss citizen is something of a pedagogue.<lb/>
This does not refer only to the governesses,<lb/>
who, like hotel-keepers, are supposed to represent<lb/>
Switzerland abroad, nor does it mean the large number<lb/>
of teachers and schoolmasters in the various secondary<lb/>
institutions, commercial, technical, and agricultural,<lb/>
nor the university professors and heads of<lb/>
private institutions of learning that are to be found<lb/>
in Switzerland. There is more than that. Every Swiss<lb/>
is more or less a pedagogue because in so small a<lb/>
country, where men are so closely packed together,<lb/>
and where order depends entirely on the discipline<lb/>
of the citizens, everybody by sheer force of circumstances<lb/>
becomes at once the teacher and the pupil of<lb/>
his neighbor. The Swiss is a great giver of advice.<lb/>
He likes to explain the handling of an instrument,<lb/>
to tell you the names of the Alps that you see, the<lb/>
history of his canton, what he is doing and what you<lb/>
ought to do. He explains with a technical earnestness<lb/>
that is full of pith and with a moral earnestness that<lb/>
easily becomes pedantic and “preachy.” Like the<lb/>
Germans, but with more humor, and above all without<lb/>
desire to impress or compel you, solely from<lb/>

curiosity as to facts and from human sympathy, the<lb/>
Swiss is didactic.<lb/>
<space/>What are the results for Switzerland itself of this<lb/>
pedagogical tendency ? A few facts will give an idea<lb/>
of them. The percentage of illiterates is the lowest<lb/>
in the world. Primary schooling, from six to thirteen<lb/>
years of age, as in the United States, is free and obligatory.<lb/>
The diploma which is given at the end of this<lb/>
schooling gives the right to secondary education, and<lb/>
the studies in the “gymnase” lead to the “Bacca-<lb/>
laureat,” which admits to the university and to the<lb/>
advanced technical schools.<lb/>
<space/>Unlike the American system, however, Swiss education<lb/>
is not entirely democratic. The primary schools<lb/>
do not all prepare for the higher grades that lead to<lb/>
the university ; if the student is to obtain his “Bachot”<lb/>
he must be placed early in a school where Latin and<lb/>
Greek are taught.<lb/>
<space/>The primary school occupies the lives of children<lb/>
—that is to say keeps them seated and motionless—for<lb/>
five hours every day from 6-13 years old. It is one<lb/>
of the fundamental Swiss institutions of the nineteenth<lb/>
and twentieth centuries. There it is that young<lb/>
Switzerland learns to be disciplined, respectful of the<lb/>
average, mistrustful of all that is out of the normal,<lb/>
either high or low—learns in short, “equality.” It<lb/>
must be admitted that if Switzerland is a land of liberty<lb/>
it is also a land of intolerance towards the best<lb/>
and the worst—the head and the tail of the class. Per<lb/>

haps democratic liberty must be paid for at this price.<lb/>
The best, if they really have a vigorous nature, succeed<lb/>
in spite of everything, if not in their own country,<lb/>
at least by the roundabout way of going abroad.<lb/>
But the weakest have a sad lot ; they lower the averages,<lb/>
and are looked down on.<lb/>
<space/>Perhaps Switzerland owes its limited number of<lb/>
paupers to the fact that extreme poverty and illiteracy<lb/>
are simply not accepted or considered possible there.<lb/>
In other European countries poverty has a kind of<lb/>
almost mystical distinction. There is a quantity of<lb/>
romantic literature that deals with Italian beggars—<lb/>
but in Switzerland no one feels they have the right<lb/>
to fall too low. A kind of general conspiracy brings<lb/>
men back to the average, willy-nilly. Genius and<lb/>
wealth hide themselves, imbecility or poverty try to<lb/>
seem to be at the normal level, and everyone helps<lb/>
them to do so.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss teacher is a sort of regulator of democratic<lb/>
life. To say of anyone in Switzerland that he<lb/>
wants to distinguish himself is an insult. This fact<lb/>
is regrettable from the spiritual and intellectual<lb/>
point of view, but it is a guarantee against tyranny.<lb/>
<space/>There are many private schools of various types<lb/>
in Switzerland, some dedicated to the most modern<lb/>
psychological investigations, and others confessional,<lb/>
but the students in these institutions are all obliged<lb/>
to pass the same final examinations as those required<lb/>
in the public schools.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>Characteristically, Switzerland has seven universities<lb/>
for a country of less than four and a half million<lb/>
inhabitants. This would be far too many for<lb/>
the needs of Switzerland itself, but a quantity of<lb/>
students come to them from foreign countries. Each<lb/>
of the French Swiss cantons has its university. It is<lb/>
not physical needs which are responsible for this,<lb/>
since Fribourg, Lausanne, Neuchatel, and Geneva are<lb/>
little more than an hour apart by train. Were these<lb/>
institutions to fuse, the resulting one would be more<lb/>
prosperous and powerful than any of them can now<lb/>
hope to be, but this would be quite contrary to Swiss<lb/>
tradition and spirit. Each university is a permanent<lb/>
cultural center, each has its own past, its own tradition<lb/>
and character. That of Fribourg is a center<lb/>
of Catholic and French civilization ; that of Geneva<lb/>
is at once Calvinist and international ; that of Neuchatel<lb/>
specializes in the law ; and that of Lausanne<lb/>
represents a sort of Vaudois “nationalism,” which<lb/>
can perhaps be explained by the fact that Vaud is<lb/>
both the largest and most predominantly peasant—<lb/>
therefore the most conservative—of the French cantons.<lb/>
As to Germanic Switzerland, it has the Universities<lb/>
of Basel (the oldest one of all) , of Zurich, of<lb/>
Berne. The Federal Polytechnical School at Zurich,<lb/>
the Engineering School at Lausanne and the School<lb/>
of Commercial Studies at St. Gall rank as universities.<lb/>

siveness is the sense of social responsibility. The conviction<lb/>
of a mutual duty between citizens manifests<lb/>
itself in a keen interest in charity and social welfare.<lb/>
This is the avocation of many men and women of<lb/>
standing. In fact, not to be active in “good works”<lb/>
would be socially damning in the best Swiss circles.<lb/>
<space/>Countless committees, boards, clubs and societies<lb/>
exist in every small town, to organize and support<lb/>
hospitals, clinics, kindergartens, and many other institutions.<lb/>
For instance, in Morges, which has about<lb/>
4,000 inhabitants and is only twelve miles from the<lb/>
city of Lausanne, there is an infirmary for the sick<lb/>
and aged poor, a preventorium1 and a home for<lb/>
feeble-minded children. There are several clinics, a<lb/>
visiting nurse, a prohibition restaurant, and a society<lb/>
for giving coffee to the women who sell vegetables in<lb/>
the streets on market day. Each of the several<lb/>
churches has charities of its own. In fact in some of<lb/>
the more prosperous communities in happier times<lb/>
there scarcely seemed to be enough unfortunates to<lb/>
absorb the energy of the charitably minded.<lb/>
<space/>In a country which is that of J. J. Rousseau and<lb/>
Pestalozzi it is not astonishing that child welfare—<lb/>
puericulture, as it is called—should be very popular.<lb/>
Clinics for pre-natal care as well as kindergartens and<lb/>
preventoria abound. In the study of feeble-mindedness<lb/>
and insanity, too, the Swiss have shown great<lb/>
interest. There are an astonishing number of hos-<lb/>
i Preventoria are homes for pre-tubercular children.<lb/>

pitals for the psychologically sick, for the Swiss give<lb/>
medical and institutional care to many persons who<lb/>
in other countries would be left at large in the community.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>Side by side with this modern spirit there is much<lb/>
conservatism in Swiss character. In so small a country,<lb/>
where a part of the land is uninhabitable and<lb/>
the rest over-populated, where all men are neighbors,<lb/>
where the soil is often barren and raw materials almost<lb/>
non-existent, everything must be used to the<lb/>
utmost and all that the ancestors have built must<lb/>
be carefully preserved. The meticulous cleanliness<lb/>
of the houses and the streets, the taste for good workmanship<lb/>
and for durable and well-finished objects,<lb/>
the hedges and walls which separate each holding so<lb/>
strictly, even the civic discipline which is at once<lb/>
rigorous and spontaneous, can be explained by the<lb/>
physical needs which weigh on each citizen and<lb/>
oblige him both to live very close to others and not<lb/>
to allow any of the goods so hardly won to be lost.<lb/>
The universal fear of waste, the conservatism which,<lb/>
though sometimes narrow, adds to life the dimension<lb/>
of historical depth, is certainly what distinguishes<lb/>
most sharply a country like Switzerland from one like<lb/>
America, where everything has been so abundant, so<lb/>
easy, that economy and the preservation of old things<lb/>
could well seem to be mere avarice or useless luxury.<lb/>

Switzerland. It is said of the stingy, with a smile, that<lb/>
when they boil eggs they send the broth to the poor.<lb/>
Prudence also has come to be almost second nature.<lb/>
Two men from a lakeside village were out sailing<lb/>
when a tremendous gale came up and seemed about<lb/>
to capsize them. “Ought we not to say a little prayer ?”<lb/>
one suggested, as the boat heaved far over in the<lb/>
wind, but the other replied cautiously: “Better not<lb/>
attract attention !”<lb/>
<space/>In Swiss homes the same careful conservatism is<lb/>
evident. Kitchen and bathroom will be ultra-modern<lb/>
but the drawing room remains Louis XVI. This gives<lb/>
a comforting sense of continuity. The Revolution<lb/>
which in France dispersed and scattered goods and<lb/>
people, in Switzerland destroyed little—to the great<lb/>
benefit of beauty-lovers of today.<lb/>
<space/>In the Chateau of Wufflens near Lausanne there<lb/>
is a set of Louis XIV furniture. It was re-covered<lb/>
with the finest petit-point tapestry at the time of<lb/>
Louis XVI, and a painting on the wall shows the<lb/>
Chatelaine of that period and her daughters embroidering<lb/>
the very chairs on which her descendants<lb/>
now sit and embroider others.<lb/>
<space/>A typical house in Morges was built upon a vast<lb/>
two-story cellar. The family fortune came from vineyards<lb/>
and when a new home was needed it was simply<lb/>
erected on top of the deep vaults where the great<lb/>
stone wine-presses stood. This same house had the<lb/>
first bathroom in that region. It consisted of a cor<lb/>

rugated zinc tub which was covered with a clean<lb/>
sheet for each bath and was filled with hot water<lb/>
brought from the kitchen stove in pails. When later<lb/>
a new bathroom was built it occurred to no one to<lb/>
do away with the old—it was kept for “second class”<lb/>
emergency baths. In that house, too, the spinning<lb/>
wheel at which members of the family remember<lb/>
seeing their grandmother work stands in one corner<lb/>
of the parlor, and some of the linen still actually in<lb/>
use was made of thread spun on it in the eighteenth<lb/>
century.<lb/>
<space/>In the Valais where the foreign service was popular<lb/>
the old uniforms are religiously kept, and they<lb/>
are worn in the procession on the feast of Corpus<lb/>
Christi. Every uniform of eighteenth-century Europe,<lb/>
French, Spanish, Austrian, Prussian, Neapolitan,<lb/>
can be seen on that day.<lb/>
<space/>Another aspect of Swiss conservatism is a tendency<lb/>
to follow the same trade or profession from generation<lb/>
to generation. Skilled artisans such as watchmakers<lb/>
are the product of a long tradition. There are<lb/>
peasant families where a knowledge of how to care<lb/>
for the vineyards and make the wine is handed on<lb/>
from father to son. Even in the professions men are<lb/>
apt to become clergymen or lawyers or doctors according<lb/>
to what their forefathers were.<lb/>

the family bond. That is true in every walk of life,<lb/>

from peasant to aristocrat. In the Catholic cantons the<lb/>
family is, of course, vigorously supported and encouraged<lb/>
by the Church. People take pride in having as<lb/>

mutual aid, within which, whether there is affection<lb/>
or not, there is great solidarity. Enormous sacrifices<lb/>
are made for it. Women will sell their jewels, men<lb/>
will mortgage their homes to save a hated cousin<lb/>
from bankruptcy. There is prudence as well as duty<lb/>
in this, for in Switzerland, as in most old and highly<lb/>
organized societies, who as well as what a man is<lb/>
counts, and the good or ill repute of his family may<lb/>
be of vital help or hindrance to him.<lb/>
<space/>This family comprises more than the mere relatives ;<lb/>
it is a clan that includes uncles and aunts,<lb/>
cousins, second-cousins, and in-laws. At a Swiss wedding<lb/>
a hundred people will often call each other kin.<lb/>
Switzerland is the land of cousins, for there has necessarily<lb/>
been much intermarriage in these small communities.<lb/>
A few years ago a genealogist of Geneva<lb/>
amused himself by establishing the exact relationship<lb/>
between Jean Jacques Rousseau and a number of<lb/>
prominent Swiss people of the day. All of them, he<lb/>

found, had some degree of kinship with the philosopher,<lb/>
but many of them were far from pleased to<lb/>
know it !<lb/>
<space/>The family is a restraint on individualism and it<lb/>
may be something of a tyranny. It involves many<lb/>
duties such as visits to a great collection of elders. In<lb/>
a family known to one of the authors there were<lb/>
seven ladies more than eighty years old who had to<lb/>
be visited on every occasion. They were not only the<lb/>
family censors but also the archivists, the keepers of<lb/>
family secrets, family genealogies, stories and traditions.<lb/>
There are interminable family dinners and solemn<lb/>
family councils of war. In some families there are<lb/>
even trust funds held in common for all the members<lb/>
and to which all the members contribute. Family<lb/>
opinion must always be reckoned with, and young<lb/>
people who are at odds with their parents or elders<lb/>
are seriously handicapped. They will be looked on<lb/>
askance by most people even if they have some justification,<lb/>
for the principle of revolt is considered dangerous.<lb/>
But, tyranny or not, the enduring power of<lb/>
the family is an essential part of the stability of Swiss<lb/>
civilization. It is a kind of social cement which holds<lb/>
the community together.<lb/>
<space/>Partly because of the importance of the family,<lb/>
Swiss society, though it is simple in its habits, is not<lb/>
democratic in the American sense. There is probably<lb/>
no milieu in the world harder to penetrate than the<lb/>
patrician groups in small Swiss cities. Neither beauty,<lb/>

wit, wealth nor fame can procure an entry into these<lb/>
circles ; but, on the other hand, those who “belong”<lb/>
are looked after and treated with consideration even<lb/>
if they are old, poor and stupid. This makes a society<lb/>
which is certainly not amusing—it would scorn<lb/>

mutual responsibility has persisted, and from the<lb/>
point of view of the community this is not an evil.<lb/>
To be of good family and to maintain the reputation<lb/>
of one’s ancestors is usually to be a good citizen.<lb/>
<space/>In this society many descendants of the once powerful<lb/>
oligarchies still exist. Sturdy and prolific, these<lb/>
families, although they have no legal rights or privileges,<lb/>

influence in their own communities.<lb/>
<space/>That there should be a Swiss aristocracy astonishes<lb/>
Americans, yet it is one of the oldest in Europe. Both<lb/>
the Habsburgs and the House of Savoy originated in<lb/>
Switzerland. More than one modest-seeming Swiss<lb/>
family has had the right, won centuries before, to<lb/>
attend without invitation the jealously guarded Imperial<lb/>
court in Vienna. It is said that a simple-minded<lb/>
member of one of these families took advantage of<lb/>
his privilege to go to a court ball. He was presented<lb/>
to the Emperor Francis Joseph and reminded him<lb/>
that their families had come from the same part of<lb/>
the world, implying that his own had once been the<lb/>
richer and more powerful of the two. “No doubt,”<lb/>

smiled the Emperor, “but you will admit that mine<lb/>
has done much better for itself !”<lb/>
<space/>In France, the nobles whose function had been to<lb/>
carry arms and to defend the land, lost their social<lb/>
significance when the King created a professional<lb/>
army instead of the feudal levies. As centralization<lb/>
increased they were attracted to Versailles and became<lb/>
mere courtiers. This set them apart from the<lb/>
bourgeoisie and the people. Moreover, French law<lb/>
did not allow a noble to engage in any sort of trade<lb/>
or commerce, or to marry, except by special dispensation,<lb/>
the daughter of a “roturier.” In Switzerland<lb/>
there was no King or court. Therefore the nobles remained<lb/>
on their land. They were in contact with<lb/>
the burghers and with the people, and often took<lb/>
part with them against the Emperor. For instance, a<lb/>
d’Erlach, member of a noble family of Berne, commanded<lb/>
the Swiss at the battle of Laupen. The Swiss<lb/>
nobles were prevented by no royally enforced law or<lb/>
custom from marrying into the rich and powerful<lb/>
burgher families of the towns.<lb/>
<space/>In the growth and government of the cantons the<lb/>
nobility played a great part. The Diesbachs, the<lb/>
Wattevilles, the Bonstettins furnished Berne with<lb/>
many of its leaders and administrators in the days<lb/>
of its power. They and other leading families gave<lb/>
bailiffs to the subject provinces and were sent as<lb/>
representatives of the city abroad.<lb/>

lands and so kept up the Swiss tradition of internationalism.<lb/>
The de Salis, a powerful family of the<lb/>
Grisons, and the de Blonays have in the past intermarried<lb/>
with ruling families. Others took service<lb/>
with foreign sovereigns. An Abbe de Watteville was<lb/>
Grand d’Espagne, French Marquis and Pasha. Fried-<lb/>
erich de Salis was the almoner of Henry IV of France ;<lb/>
Andreas de Salis, vicar of the Valteline, was a secret<lb/>
agent of Louis XIV. Instances might be multiplied.<lb/>
In Neuchatel many aristocrats took service with the<lb/>
King of Prussia, who was the nominal sovereign of<lb/>
the principality. The de Pourtales are a notable instance<lb/>
of a family whose internationalism has lasted<lb/>
to our own day. One of them helped in the last century<lb/>
to found Colorado Springs, another was German<lb/>
ambassador to Petrograd, while many served with the<lb/>
French army.<lb/>
<space/>With the growth of the modern world the position<lb/>
of such nobles, both as landowners and administrators,<lb/>
became less important. Many of their privileges<lb/>
disappeared at the time of the French Revolution.<lb/>
The titles and documents of others were destroyed<lb/>
by a rising in the late eighteenth century called in<lb/>
dialect the “burla papai” or “burn the papers.” At<lb/>
this time many of them handed over their parchments<lb/>
of their own accord. Three wagonloads of<lb/>
papers were taken away from the castle of Wufflens<lb/>
and burned, to the acute regret of modern historians.<lb/>

But the peasants in Switzerland did not burn chateau<lb/>
and nobles, too, as they did in France.<lb/>
<space/>Some of these old families are today impoverished<lb/>
and live very modestly, with only their names to recall<lb/>
past glories. Other old families, adapting themselves<lb/>
to the times, have kept their lands, and still<lb/>
play a part in Swiss life. One branch of a family may<lb/>
be poor, another rich ; one cousin may literally be a<lb/>
cow-herd while another lives in a castle. The de<lb/>
Blonays, for example, who were once the powerful<lb/>
rivals of the Counts of Savoy, still own the massive<lb/>
pile above Vevey which bears their name, and another<lb/>
branch of the family possesses the historic castle<lb/>
of Grandson on Lake Neuchatel and keeps it up with<lb/>
almost feudal splendor. Today lawyers, architects<lb/>
and doctors often bear historic names, and these<lb/>
names have prestige in a land where tradition counts.<lb/>
Their owners may be elected to office, particularly<lb/>
in times of difficulty, or become officers.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss bourgeoisie, too, has traditions. A Lul-<lb/>
lin, a Turretini, a Tronchin, a Micheli of Geneva,<lb/>
an Iselin or a Burckhardt of Basel yield to none in<lb/>
pride of race. They feel themselves to be the equals<lb/>
of any titled family in Europe and look on French<lb/>
people who were ennobled by the Empire as far less<lb/>
authentically aristocratic than themselves.<lb/>

today to be “nationalized” in Switzerland a foreigner<lb/>
must obtain the right of bourgeoisie in some Swiss<lb/>
city or village.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss have a deep sense of the moral significance<lb/>
of life. In their country there are many shrines,<lb/>
among them St. Maurice en Valais, where the<lb/>
Theban Legion was martyred, and where some of<lb/>
the most magnificent religious treasures in Europe<lb/>
are to be found ; the great Abbey of Einsiedeln ; the<lb/>
Houses of the famous Order of St. Bernard, which<lb/>
is native to Switzerland ; and also Calvin’s famous<lb/>
Church in Geneva.<lb/>
<space/>No land is more devout than Catholic Switzerland.<lb/>
In its villages the Church is the center of life and<lb/>
the priest the most important person in the community.<lb/>
His influence is so great that the accusation<lb/>
often made against these communities that they are<lb/>
priest-ridden is not wholly without foundation.<lb/>
<space/>Many proofs of the fervor of Swiss faith exist. The<lb/>
little mountain community of Lens, which is very<lb/>
poor according to Swiss standards, some years ago<lb/>
erected a colossal statue of Christ on a rock dominating<lb/>
the village, where it can be seen throughout<lb/>
the surrounding country. The cost of this statue was<lb/>
out of all proportion to the resources of the town,<lb/>
and, sad to say, it is very ugly ; yet the people are<lb/>
delightedly proud of it. In the region called Saviez<lb/>

a beautiful old church is the center of several villages.<lb/>
The people of these hamlets have made many<lb/>
sacrifices to repair and keep it up, and recently they<lb/>
equipped it with stained glass windows made by a<lb/>
great artist. The example has been followed by a<lb/>
hundred or more villages, Catholic and Protestant,<lb/>
which have restored their fine old churches.<lb/>
<space/>The Federal Government built a huge dam in the<lb/>
valley of the Dixence at an altitude of 9,000 feet or<lb/>
more, in order to increase Switzerland’s water power.<lb/>
Beside the dam, at the foot of the glacier, the workers<lb/>
built a little chapel, very simple but pure in line,<lb/>
of stone taken from the mountain. It is significant to<lb/>
find this shrine of the old faith beside the most recent<lb/>
work of modern engineers.<lb/>
<space/>A Mass in any of the large mountain villages is a<lb/>
remarkable sight. The whole community is there in<lb/>
costume, and often the Mass will be followed by the<lb/>
transaction of public business in the nearby square,<lb/>
for it is the one occasion when all the people assemble.<lb/>
In the season of military service the soldiers who<lb/>
are in the village stand in the aisles and salute with<lb/>
drawn sword or port of arms the reading of the Gospel<lb/>
and the elevation of the Host. No division exists<lb/>
there between Church and State, between spiritual<lb/>
and temporal power. These celebrations give a moving<lb/>
sense of the unity of a whole people.<lb/>

Protestant cantons. The Swiss National Church and<lb/>

also the so-called “Free” Church, which are both Calvinist,<lb/>
are very much alive. The “Pasteur” is an important<lb/>
figure in most communities. He plays very<lb/>
much the same part that the clergymen of the Church<lb/>
of England have long played in the English countryside.<lb/>
Moreover Protestantism in Switzerland, as in<lb/>
America, has deeply colored the whole thought and<lb/>
philosophy of the nation. It has, by their own admission,<lb/>
influenced the Catholic population, as well as<lb/>
those who do not believe. It is this firm basis of Christian<lb/>
philosophy which makes the Swiss continue to<lb/>
look at life from a moral point of view. It has saved<lb/>
them, to some extent, from the crass materialism of<lb/>
the age and, together with the old tradition of independence,<lb/>
it has armed them against Nazi propaganda.<lb/>
Such a speech as that of Colonel Fry, quoted<lb/>
in Chapter XI, is possible only in a country where<lb/>
spiritual and moral values have continued to be<lb/>
dominant.<lb/>
<space/>On the other hand, the attitude of mind which is<lb/>
loosely called puritanical is very prevalent. The Swiss<lb/>
village of today is much like the New England town<lb/>
of a hundred years ago. Duty is exacting and there is<lb/>
a deep reverence for propriety and decorum. This<lb/>
unconscious puritanism is evident in an instinctive<lb/>
distrust of frivolity, in a parade of simplicity, and a<lb/>
sort of pride in austerity and even in suffering. It is<lb/>
said that in Geneva people mount on stilts to exhibit<lb/>
their mourning ! This attitude of mind is particularly<lb/>

evident in French Switzerland. There people feel<lb/>
that it is dangerous, perhaps even immoral, to be too<lb/>
happy or too fortunate. Pleasure is light-minded and<lb/>
enjoyment of this world’s goods has an odor of brimstone.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>A certain amount of hypocrisy accompanies this<lb/>
puritanism, as it undoubtedly did in New England.<lb/>
People do not always live up to the principles which<lb/>
they profess, and the Swiss in this respect are like<lb/>
others. They continue, however, to respect the principles<lb/>
of morality even when in practice they disregard<lb/>
them. Those who break the moral law must be<lb/>
careful not to be found out. All this is familiar to<lb/>
Americans, and in fact, Anglo-Saxons feel at home<lb/>
in Switzerland more readily than in Latin countries,<lb/>
for the taboos are the same. It must be added that<lb/>
puritanism is largely a middle-class phenomenon.<lb/>
The peasant who lives near to nature is no prude,<lb/>
and his rigid morality is tempered by sound common<lb/>
sense.<lb/>
<space/>With the development of great cities and the<lb/>
growth of large-scale industry the American point<lb/>
of view has changed much during the last forty years.<lb/>
In Switzerland this has been less the case. Life there<lb/>
is simpler and more intimate. It is more highly organized<lb/>
in the human domain, although—or perhaps<lb/>
because—it is less highly developed in the mechanical<lb/>
and physical plane. Religion and the family are still<lb/>
vital influences. Divorce, though growing in fre<lb/>

quency, is not so widespread as in America. Men and<lb/>
women still go to church as a rule, both because they<lb/>
want to and because public opinion expects it. There<lb/>
is little cynicism, and the old standards have been to<lb/>
a large extent maintained.<lb/>
<space/>One reason for this is that the Swiss in spite of<lb/>
their taste for travel, and the marked successes which<lb/>
they have won in foreign countries, are not a very<lb/>
mobile people. Those who do not expatriate themselves<lb/>
are apt to remain attached to one spot, one<lb/>
community.<lb/>
<space/>Provincialism can be stuffy, and a jealous fear of<lb/>
superiority, a tendency to petty judgments, are the<lb/>
defects of small communities. These undoubtedly exist<lb/>
in Switzerland, but they are mitigated by the international<lb/>
currents which flow through the country,<lb/>
opening wide horizons to the people of its quiet little<lb/>
towns.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss qualities—hardihood, simplicity, traditionalism,<lb/>
social-mindedness, and a moral outlook-<lb/>
have made a society that is sure of its values and<lb/>
clear as to its aims. It is the existence of these common<lb/>
qualities and aims among people so different in<lb/>
all other respects that makes the Federal State possible.<lb/>

</p>
        <p rend="block big">
Of all the paradoxes that Switzerland incorporates,<lb/>
the most remarkable is the prosperity enjoyed in a<lb/>
land so ill-endowed by nature. The casual tourist,<lb/>
crossing the country and seeing rocks and glaciers,<lb/>
narrow gorges and dark forests, with villages precariously<lb/>
perched on steep and arid slopes, thinks of it<lb/>
as a splendid wilderness ; and he is not wholly mistaken,<lb/>
for the land is poor.<lb/>
<space/>The area of Switzerland (15,940 square miles) is<lb/>
only about one-half that of the State of Maine (33,040<lb/>
square miles). Nearly a quarter (22.6 per cent) is unfit<lb/>
for cultivation or for human habitation. In spite<lb/>
of this it is densely populated, with a hundred inhabitants<lb/>
per square mile. It has, moreover, none of the<lb/>
natural resources—coal, oil, precious metals and so on<lb/>
—which are crucial in a modern industrial society. Its<lb/>
arable land is severely limited both in quantity and<lb/>
quality. It has no overseas empire, no colonies as have<lb/>
other small countries like Holland, Belgium, and Portugal,<lb/>
to supply it with raw materials and to absorb<lb/>
its manufactured products on preferential terms. It<lb/>
has, finally, no seacoast, with the possibility of trade<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
and commerce which that advantage implies. It is<lb/>
physically a small, poor, land-locked country.<lb/>
<space/>Yet Switzerland enjoys a standard of living far<lb/>
higher than those of many nations richer in natural<lb/>
resources such as Hungary, Rumania, or Italy. Not<lb/>
only is the average Swiss income relatively high, but<lb/>
it is evenly distributed and, as we have seen, a great<lb/>
deal of comfort and well-being are to be found in<lb/>
most Swiss homes. One need not be a materialist to<lb/>
see that this fact is of vital importance in judging<lb/>
the success of the Federal State.<lb/>
<space/>Swiss prosperity is an absolute rebuttal of the current<lb/>
assumption that the one basis for a thriving industry<lb/>
and national wealth is the possession of physical<lb/>
resources. This idea lies behind the German claim<lb/>
for “living room,” that is to say, political domination<lb/>
over the lands which supply them with raw materials.<lb/>
The Swiss have never controlled their markets nor<lb/>
their sources of raw materials, yet they have built up<lb/>
one of the most successful industrial structures of our<lb/>
era.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland is not merely a land of mountaintops<lb/>
and rural villages. Almost a half of its working population<lb/>
(forty-six per cent) is engaged in one form or<lb/>
another of manufacture. Less than thirty per cent live<lb/>
by agriculture. The remaining fifth work in hotels,<lb/>
in transport, in the professions and in the administration.<lb/>
On the whole, then, the Swiss economy is<lb/>
surprisingly industrialized.<lb/>
</p>
      </div>

134<lb/>
</p>
        <p>
THE HEART OF EUROPE<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big"><space/>The most important single fact about the economic<lb/>
working of Switzerland is that her foreign trade per<lb/>
capita is higher than that of any other industrialized<lb/>
country in the world. It has been calculated that<lb/>
seventy francs’ worth of goods are exported every<lb/>
year per inhabitant. This is an extraordinary achievement<lb/>
for a country with limited natural resources<lb/>
and with a relatively large agricultural population.<lb/>
<space/>How has this paradox of prosperity in a land that<lb/>
is naturally poor been achieved ? It is often assumed<lb/>
today that centralization is a great economic advantage<lb/>
to every nation ; that only a strong Government<lb/>
with wide powers of coordination and coercion can<lb/>
secure efficiency, well-being, and a high level of prosperity.<lb/>
Decentralization, it is said, weakens the national<lb/>
economy, lowers efficiency, and places the<lb/>
country at a grave disadvantage in dealing with other<lb/>
nations where state control is more advanced. Switzerland<lb/>
absolutely contradicts this premise.<lb/>
<space/>Economic liberalism, at least since the publication<lb/>
of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, has carried with<lb/>
it certain specific, almost technical connotations ; it<lb/>
has meant relatively free competition internally, relatively<lb/>
free trade with foreign nations ; it has called for<lb/>
a concentration on those pursuits for which a country<lb/>
was best fitted by its natural advantages, and for a<lb/>
maximum of ingenuity and efficiency in the development<lb/>
of such advantages. In recent times the precepts<lb/>
of economic liberalism have been expanded to admit<lb/>

a measure of government intervention or co-operative<lb/>
enterprise in cases where private initiative fails to act,<lb/>
or acts in a manner detrimental to the public interest.<lb/>
Examples of this in modern Switzerland are laws designed<lb/>
to achieve social security and to prevent the<lb/>
destruction of timber resources.<lb/>
<space/>Both the structure and the institutions of the Swiss<lb/>
economy conform to liberalism thus defined. The<lb/>
Swiss have not had the illusion that they could profitably<lb/>
be self-sufficient. They have regarded themselves<lb/>
as part of a world economy, and their high standard<lb/>
of living attests the benefits they have derived from<lb/>
this outlook. In the present era their commercial and<lb/>
industrial success has been won by a high degree of<lb/>
specialization and by the almost miserly exploitation<lb/>
of every natural advantage.<lb/>
<space/>In agriculture, for example, the Swiss did not attempt<lb/>
fully to supply their own food requirements.<lb/>
They made a virtue of necessity. More than a third of<lb/>
the productive land has been turned over to cattleraising.<lb/>
Grain, fruit, and vegetables are imported on<lb/>
a considerable scale while the uniquely Swiss agricultural<lb/>
products—cheese, condensed milk and chocolate<lb/>
—are exported. Each of these commodities represents<lb/>
a more or less refined stage of manufacture. It is typical<lb/>
of the Swiss economy that its agricultural resources<lb/>
are worked to their most advanced point before<lb/>
they are sent abroad.<lb/>

on foods imported from abroad ; only a quarter of<lb/>
their foreign imports are foodstuffs. It is rather that<lb/>
they have preferred, when international conditions<lb/>
permitted, to trade their way to a higher standard of<lb/>
living. This they could do because of the highly specialized<lb/>
character of their products. But in times of<lb/>
war, when international markets were cut off, Switzerland<lb/>
has been able, largely, to feed herself. Even then<lb/>
her particular wares have been of use to her. From<lb/>
1914 to 1918 she was able to exchange chocolate and<lb/>
cheese with her neighbors in return for the coal and<lb/>
wheat she needed.<lb/>
<space/>The tendency fully to exploit domestic manufacturing<lb/>
skills is evident throughout Swiss industry. Except<lb/>
for an abundant supply of potential waterpower<lb/>
Switzerland contains virtually no physical resources<lb/>
on which a national industrial structure could be<lb/>
erected. The mineral riches of the land are confined<lb/>

nation.<lb/>

imports are foodstuffs ; the remainder is made up<lb/>
equally of raw materials and manufactured goods.<lb/>

tured state. Raw materials represent only seven per<lb/>
cent of Switzerland’s export trade, foodstuffs six<lb/>
per cent and manufactured goods eighty-seven per<lb/>
cent. That is to say, roughly ninety per cent of those<lb/>
products which are sent abroad have been increased<lb/>
in value by Swiss ingenuity and craftsmanship.<lb/>

as follows (in per cent of total value) :<lb/>

of Swiss exports are goods whose production demands<lb/>
advanced skills. Watches, electrical machinery, engines<lb/>
of various types, embroidered and woven goods,<lb/>
form more than fifty-five per cent of them.<lb/>
<space/>In order to win and keep their place in the world<lb/>
market the Swiss have relied to some extent on their<lb/>

easy rail access to Austria, France, Germany, and<lb/>
Italy. This has, in some degree, compensated for the<lb/>

upon the quality of their production. In this they<lb/>
have been aided by the possession of many highly<lb/>
skilled workers, and the peculiar combination, in<lb/>
many domains, of individual effort with co-operation.<lb/>
<space/>In agriculture the use of all available resources is<lb/>
particularly striking. The highest vineyards and the<lb/>
highest wheat fields in the world are in Switzerland.<lb/>
Tourists who travel in the canton of the Valais, in<lb/>
the Bernese Oberland, the Grisons, or in any of the<lb/>
Swiss mountain districts are always astonished to see<lb/>
villages perched on the mountainside at apparently<lb/>
inaccessible heights, barns and lofts built among the<lb/>
rocks. The pastures run often to the very foot of the<lb/>
glaciers. No inch of ground is lost, and the sure-footed<lb/>
cattle wander in uplands which from the valley look<lb/>
unbelievably steep and remote.<lb/>
<space/>In the lake regions the vineyards are a great source<lb/>
of wealth, and it is the steep and sun-baked slopes<lb/>
which yield the best grapes. These slopes have been<lb/>
carefully terraced so as to lose no inch of precious soil,<lb/>
and they have been buttressed against the torrential<lb/>
rains. Around Lake Leman they run down to the very<lb/>
edge of the water and up to the rim of the forest,<lb/>
where vines will no longer grow. The enormous labor<lb/>
required to develop these terraced vineyards was undertaken<lb/>
long ago by the monks. The names of the<lb/>
Valaisan wines still recall their ancient origin:<lb/>
Amigne was once “vinum amoenum,” Umagne was<lb/>
“vinum humanum,” and the Heide Wein was the<lb/>

wine of the pagans. The labor of keeping up terraces<lb/>
and buttressed slopes is endless. A storm which brings<lb/>
down stones and earth from above may necessitate<lb/>
months of repair work. Forest conservation has also<lb/>
been developed to a high point in Switzerland, and<lb/>
Swiss foresters are famous in Europe. The most remote<lb/>
sections of the mountain ranges are watched<lb/>
over carefully, and wasteful deforestation is unknown.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>A striking example of the Swiss capacity for using<lb/>
every asset is their tourist trade. It was the “mad<lb/>
English travelers” who taught them in the eighteenth<lb/>
century the commercial value of their mountains and<lb/>
lakes. A network of roads, of hotels, and later of<lb/>
funicular railways grew up all over the country. The<lb/>
Swiss love of order and cleanliness, their gift for organization<lb/>
makes them such excellent hotel-keepers<lb/>
that a number of the best hotels all over the world,<lb/>
including all the Ritz establishments, are owned and<lb/>
run by Swiss. There are several important schools for<lb/>
hotel-keepers in Switzerland whose diplomas are internationally<lb/>
respected.<lb/>
<space/>The tourist trade is not, as foreigners are apt to<lb/>
imagine, the most important Swiss industry ; yet it<lb/>
did bring a considerable sum of money into the country<lb/>
every year, and it gave employment to a considerable<lb/>
number of people. The funds it drew were,<lb/>
moreover, foreign exchange and thus directly applica<lb/>

ble to the purchase of the imports upon which the<lb/>
nation thrived.<lb/>
<space/>After the first World War, however, life in Switzerland<lb/>
became relatively expensive because the Swiss<lb/>
franc was not devalued to the level of other currencies.<lb/>
Other regions—the Riviera, the Dalmatian Coast,<lb/>
the Austrian Tyrol—began to attract the wandering<lb/>
Britain or American. The Swiss hotels never fully recovered<lb/>
their prosperity. Efforts were made to keep<lb/>
the tourist industry alive in the hope of an eventual<lb/>
return of the foreign clientele. Hotels were often kept<lb/>
open at a loss and prices were cut to the bone. Yet<lb/>
the tourist trade failed to revive and the world depression<lb/>
accentuated its decline after 1929.<lb/>
<space/>Swiss schools have also had a large foreign following.<lb/>
People sent their children to them to learn<lb/>
French or German and to profit by the outdoor life<lb/>
which these institutions offered. The quality of Swiss<lb/>
education attracted parents in England, Holland, and<lb/>
the Scandinavian countries as well as in America.<lb/>
Here, too, post-war conditions affected Switzerland<lb/>
unfavorably.<lb/>
<space/>Perhaps the most important example of Switzerland’s<lb/>
determination to use all its resources has been<lb/>
the development of waterpower. Few countries are<lb/>
richer in this, for the head-waters of many rivers are<lb/>
in its mountain ranges ; and its high-lying lakes can<lb/>
be dammed so as to give an enormous fall. The exploitation<lb/>
of “white-coal” began early, but it was<lb/>

speeded up by the experience of 1914-1918. The<lb/>
greatest hardship of Switzerland during the first<lb/>
World War was the lack of coal. Having almost no<lb/>
supply of its own, it was obliged to bargain with its<lb/>
neighbors for the quantity absolutely necessary for its<lb/>
railroads, factories, and homes. Determined that this<lb/>
should not happen again, it began after 1918 to develop<lb/>
to a much higher point its electrical resources.<lb/>
Nearly all its railroads and by far the greater part<lb/>
of its industries are now electrified. Vast new dams<lb/>
have been built in recent years so that by 1939 Switzerland<lb/>
was able to sell power to its neighbors as well<lb/>
as to make the fullest use of it at home.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland has cultivated intensely not only its<lb/>
pasturage, vineyards, forests, and waterpower, but<lb/>
also the skills of its working population. In agriculture<lb/>
itself, in dairy work, in the culture of the grape<lb/>
and the making of wine, the Swiss are experienced<lb/>
and have developed great technical skill. So much is<lb/>
this the case in regard to wine that as early as the<lb/>
eighteenth century when Catherine the Great of<lb/>
Russia wanted to establish vineyards in Bessarabia<lb/>
she sent for peasants from the canton of Vaud to<lb/>
teach the people of her country their methods. A<lb/>
colony of Vaudois still exists in that remote province.<lb/>
Swiss viticulturists have been very successful in Algeria<lb/>
also, and in the United States.<lb/>
<space/>In industry, hereditary skills have been of importance.<lb/>
We have seen that the watch-making industry<lb/>

leads in the list of Swiss exports. This is because nowhere<lb/>
else in the world can a comparable group of<lb/>
skilled artisans for this delicate trade be found. The<lb/>
Swiss worker virtually defies competition. Even in<lb/>
America and in France those who make or repair<lb/>
high-grade watches are almost always Swiss. The makers<lb/>
of the finest watchsprings earn as much as ten or<lb/>
even twenty dollars a day at their trade—an enormous<lb/>
sum for Switzerland—and they could not easily be<lb/>
replaced, for it requires early training and long experience<lb/>
to acquire the necessary fineness of touch and<lb/>
precision of movement.<lb/>
<space/>In the making of electrical machinery, turbines,<lb/>
generators, cables, meters, and so on, Switzerland has<lb/>
excelled largely because of the quality of its labor.<lb/>
It enjoys, as well, a reputation for the quality of its<lb/>
steam and internal combustion engines, Diesel motors,<lb/>
pumps, mills, and all kinds of scientific instruments<lb/>
and instruments of precision, and these specialized<lb/>
industries also require highly skilled labor.<lb/>
<space/>Various forms of co-operation, many with a long<lb/>
tradition, play a role in Switzerland equivalent to<lb/>
centralized planning in other nations. A large part of<lb/>
the agricultural population of Switzerland lives in<lb/>
hamlets or villages. Each of these is a more or less independent<lb/>
entity, whose prosperity does not come<lb/>
from the neighboring cities nor from passersby, but<lb/>
rather from its own appanage of fields, vineyards, or<lb/>
high pasture lands and alps. The economic aspects of<lb/>

communal life in these mountain districts are particularly<lb/>
interesting.<lb/>
<space/>The grazing lands, or “alps,” are in large part the<lb/>
property of the village. These pastures often lie at a<lb/>
great distance from the community to which they<lb/>
belong, and they are usually at different altitudes, the<lb/>
lower ones, called “mayens,” being used in the spring,<lb/>
and other higher ones in midsummer. To these various<lb/>
pastures the village herds are driven in April or<lb/>
May. Every inhabitant of the village has the right to<lb/>
send his cows with the common herd and the herdsman<lb/>
is chosen and paid by the community. He spends<lb/>
the whole summer on the alps, moving his herd according<lb/>
to the state of the weather and the pasturage,<lb/>
and making on the spot the cheeses which are a large<lb/>
part of the wealth of the community. These cheeses<lb/>
belong to the village as a whole. They are sold in due<lb/>
season and the produce is divided among the villagers<lb/>
in proportion to the number and quality of cows that<lb/>
they have had in the herd. It is impossible to buy a<lb/>
cheese from the cow-herd upon the alp, as tourists<lb/>
sometimes discover. He cannot sell them because they<lb/>
do not belong to him. He is responsible for them to<lb/>
the village whose employee he is.<lb/>
<space/>Many of the lower pasture lands and often the villages<lb/>
themselves depend on glacial water brought<lb/>
down from the high regions in irrigating ditches<lb/>
which are called “bisses.” These ditches are often very<lb/>
old. Some of them, in fact, date back to the fourteenth<lb/>

and fifteenth centuries. They were originally built by<lb/>
the peasants of the community and in many cases they<lb/>
still belong to the descendants of those who made<lb/>
them. Ownership in the bisse goes with ownership<lb/>
of the land.<lb/>
<space/>Built to bring the water down as directly as possible<lb/>
to the fields and pastures with the least possible loss<lb/>
on the way, a bisse often runs right against the face of<lb/>
the mountain. It is supported on iron stakes driven<lb/>
into the rocks, so that it hangs over a precipice two<lb/>
thousand feet deep with a wall two thousand feet<lb/>
high above. It is made of planks, and a narrow path<lb/>
runs beside the box which carries the water. The<lb/>
bisse must be kept up and repaired, and the responsibility<lb/>
for doing so rests with the owners of the lands<lb/>
which it waters. A share in the ditch brinsis the riaiht<lb/>
to so many hours of water per week, but also the obligation<lb/>
of helping to keep it up. Every year in the<lb/>
spring when the planks are slippery a few men fall<lb/>
from these vertiginous aerial paths and as one walks<lb/>
along the bisse one sees from time to time a cross cut<lb/>
in the wall of rock. Here someone fell—pray for his<lb/>
soul ! These ditches, held in common for centuries by<lb/>
the members of a community, are characteristic products<lb/>
of the Swiss combination of individualism and<lb/>
co-operative enterprise.<lb/>
<space/>Another aspect of village co-operation is the institution<lb/>
of the public baker. Bread is the staple article of<lb/>
diet. The oven usually belongs to the whole village,<lb/>

and the bread is baked once a week or sometimes<lb/>
once a month for the community. The baker is almost<lb/>
a political personage. In some villages he is elected<lb/>
for a year or for a period of months.<lb/>
<space/>In the villages of the lower regions co-operation has<lb/>
been of particular value in the cheese and wine industries.<lb/>
Quality is important to both of these products.<lb/>
Standardized production for commercial purposes<lb/>
tends, as a rule, to lower quality, but with both<lb/>
wine and cheese, local conditions, such as weather or<lb/>
soil, may cause great variation in the product from<lb/>
place to place and from year to year. The dairy and<lb/>
wine co-operatives of Switzerland have improved<lb/>
rather than lowered the quality of the goods, especially<lb/>
in districts where this was second-rate. The<lb/>
finest wines of Vaud, or the Valais or Neuchatel,<lb/>
are still privately owned, and so, too, are the best<lb/>
cheeses of Gruyere, but the co-operatives have helped<lb/>
production in less-favored regions.<lb/>
<space/>For instance, in the wine-growing district known as<lb/>
“La Cote” which lies between Lausanne and Geneva,<lb/>
the wine is of second-rate quality, and in years when<lb/>
there is little sun it is very acid.1 There are some better<lb/>
vineyards in the region, however, and a good year<lb/>
will give wine that is acceptable. The viticultural co-<lb/>
i It is said that in Gualion, where grow the highest vineyards o£<lb/>
the canton of Vaud, that when the time comes to vintage the mayor<lb/>
puts a bunch of grapes under his saddle and rides around the town.<lb/>
If the grapes have run they vintage at once, but if the grapes are<lb/>
hard and still intact they wait a week to make the wine.<lb/>

operatives mix the wines from the various vineyards<lb/>
so as to give an average blend and they will hold the<lb/>
wine of bad years over to mix it with that of better<lb/>
ones. Few peasants could afford to keep their vintage<lb/>
from year to year in this way. The co-operatives bottle<lb/>
the wine in standard form and advertise it so that it<lb/>
may find a market wider than the local one. Moreover<lb/>
both in Vaud and Valais the co-operatives have made<lb/>
possible the use of modern machinery, such as hydraulic<lb/>
wine presses, which enormously decrease the<lb/>
labor of the vintage, but which are far beyond the<lb/>
means of the individual wine growers.<lb/>
<space/>The cheese-making co-operatives have given the<lb/>
peasants a stable market for his milk. They have to<lb/>
some extent standardized Swiss cheese, but not entirely<lb/>
to the disadvantage of the public, for they have<lb/>
been strong enough to fight against the competition<lb/>
of poorer products from the French Jura and to protect<lb/>
the title of “Switzerland Cheese.” This is the only<lb/>
genuine article and it is made in some three thousand<lb/>
Kasereien, many of them quite small. It is gathered,<lb/>
tested, and marketed abroad by the powerful co-operative<lb/>
association whose advertisements are familiar to<lb/>
American readers. Here the work of a resourceful<lb/>
and well-organized co-operative has enabled the Swiss<lb/>
product to compete with the cheap imitations produced<lb/>
by Dutch, German, Scandinavian, and even<lb/>
pirate Swiss cheeses. A curious result of the cheese cooperatives<lb/>
is that in Switzerland, the land of cows, it<lb/>

is difficult to get cream or milk in small quantities.<lb/>
Almost all goes to the co-operatives.<lb/>
<space/>Yet the co-operatives in Switzerland have not taken<lb/>
on the importance they had in Denmark. They have<lb/>
improved the economic life of the peasant by allowing<lb/>
the use of modern methods and modern machinery.<lb/>
They have helped him to market his products,<lb/>
but this problem was not acute, for Switzerland consumes<lb/>
a large part of her own wines and a goodly<lb/>
proportion of her own cheeses. Swiss co-operatives<lb/>
have not, therefore, become a sort of autonomous<lb/>
power, a state within the state, as seems to have been<lb/>
to some extent the case in the Scandinavian countries.<lb/>
In Switzerland co-operation is a method of production,<lb/>
not a solution of the social problem.<lb/>
<space/>That the general standard of living in Switzerland<lb/>
is high is due also to the relatively wide and even<lb/>
distribution of wealth. Swiss farms and landholdings<lb/>
are on the average small. The country does not lend<lb/>
itself to vast estates. The scale and technique of Swiss<lb/>
farming bear a close resemblance to those used in<lb/>
neighboring France and Southern Germany. The<lb/>
same variety of culture, the same relative self-sufficiency,<lb/>
exist. On most farms pigs and chickens, vegetables,<lb/>
a crop of potatoes, hops, or a small vineyard,<lb/>
and often a few beehives supplement the main crop.<lb/>
<space/>There is great independence in the life of the Swiss<lb/>
land-owning peasant. Unlike the American farmer,<lb/>
he looks on the land as a way of life, not as a business.<lb/>

Food, lodging, security for himself and his family, are<lb/>
the greater part of what he expects to get from his<lb/>
farm. He uses much of what he raises himself, and<lb/>
sells the surplus, a calf or two, a few pigs and chickens,<lb/>
eggs, butter, or vegetables, in a nearby market.<lb/>
The well-to-do peasant kills his own pigs, smokes his<lb/>
hams, prepares his sausages. He makes his own wine<lb/>
or beer, and these are usually of excellent quality,<lb/>
often far better than that served in the hotels.<lb/>
<space/>Such holdings are rather like the subsistence farms<lb/>
which have been talked of occasionally in America as<lb/>
a solution for unemployment. Garden and dove-cote,<lb/>
beehive and orchard, help to enrich life. They are<lb/>
sometimes almost as lucrative as the wheat fields or<lb/>
the pasture. There are many kinds of labor and of<lb/>
yield which complete and sustain each other, forming<lb/>
a sort of rustic cycle, so that for the peasant no year<lb/>
is wholly bad, and life, though it follows a regular<lb/>
pattern, is not monotonous.<lb/>
<space/>The existence of local markets is an important<lb/>
factor in the economic life of the Swiss countryside.<lb/>
In every town some particular square or street is<lb/>
given over at least once a week to the market. There<lb/>
the women of the countryside come to sell their butter<lb/>
and eggs, their surplus vegetables, their chickens,<lb/>
their honey, and sometimes flowers from their gardens<lb/>
and mushrooms from the nearby woods. In the<lb/>
meantime, the men will dispose of a pig, a calf, or a<lb/>

for the year. This enables the country people to<lb/>
escape the tyranny of the middleman. They can sell<lb/>
their surplus from week to week and do not have to<lb/>
pack their produce for the city market.<lb/>
<space/>Obviously these methods, though primitive in the<lb/>
eyes of the American business farmer, help the rural<lb/>
community to be self-sufficient. Only a generation<lb/>
ago, an eccentric Swiss landowner boasted that he<lb/>
could raise all he needed on his own estate. In addition<lb/>
to food and wine, he grew flax, kept a few sheep<lb/>
for wool, cultivated silkworms on his mulberry trees<lb/>
and raised a little tobacco and some beets for sugar.<lb/>
He burned the wood from his own forest and even<lb/>
went so far as to use home-made tallow candles or<lb/>
colza oil to light his house. Tea, coffee, and salt were<lb/>
all that he absolutely had to buy. Of course, this<lb/>
assertion of economic independence was expensive<lb/>
and artificial. It is true, however, that a peasant farm<lb/>
may be to a large extent a self-sufficient unit.<lb/>
<space/>There is, of course, some poverty in the industrial<lb/>
cities of Switzerland, and the usual problems of the<lb/>
liberal state, unemployment and labor disputes, have<lb/>
arisen. They have not, however, been as troublesome<lb/>
as in most other industrial countries. One reason for<lb/>
this is that until recent years the connection between<lb/>
the urban and the rural populations was very close.<lb/>

in small communities, where the workers can have<lb/>
gardens or even small farms or vineyards, and so be<lb/>

This combination of rural and industrial life makes<lb/>
for contentment and stability.<lb/>
<space/>Swiss manufacturing plants are, for the most part,<lb/>
small units employing trained workers, although<lb/>
there are some notable exceptions. The goods made<lb/>
in these factories must be marketed abroad, and this,<lb/>
as a keen critic of Switzerland has pointed out, fosters<lb/>
a kind of “conservative cosmopolitanism” even<lb/>
among the workers, and tends to make them as eager<lb/>
for industrial peace at home as for international<lb/>
peace abroad.<lb/>
<space/>The relative liberalism of the nineteenth century<lb/>
was very favorable to Swiss economy, and until 1914<lb/>
the country enjoyed an expanding national wealth.<lb/>
The first world war put a great strain upon Switzerland’s<lb/>
resources, yet, on the other hand, neutrality<lb/>
had some advantages. Switzerland was able to sell its<lb/>
goods to all its warring neighbors. There was a boom<lb/>
in certain branches of Swiss industry, just as there was<lb/>
in America. This boom, however, was short-lived.<lb/>

higher and higher, until they almost hid the countries<lb/>
themselves. The map was truly symbolic. Each country<lb/>
was determined to export a maximum and import<lb/>
a minimum of goods. Obviously such a state of things<lb/>
was peculiarly unfavorable to Switzerland, yet Swiss<lb/>
industry managed to survive, and Swiss statesmen pursued<lb/>
a classic liberal policy to the last ditch.<lb/>
<space/>The inherent conservatism of the people and their<lb/>
leaders was never more clearly illustrated than during<lb/>
the years that followed upon 1929. Switzerland shared<lb/>
the sharp decline in world trade that then occurred.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>What lay behind this policy was a deep-seated mistrust<lb/>
of the kind of currency manipulation then in<lb/>
vogue. It was associated in the Swiss mind with inflation.<lb/>
Depreciation of the currency would have meant<lb/>
some rise in domestic prices, and those who lived on<lb/>
fixed incomes would have suffered. It would have<lb/>
meant, especially, a decline in value of the widely<lb/>
held Swiss Government bonds. Moreover, experience<lb/>
seemed to show that inflation was only a palliative,<lb/>
not a remedy for the difficulties of international<lb/>
trade. Wisely or not the Swiss chose the hard course.<lb/>
They preserved the traditional integrity of the Swiss<lb/>
franc in the world market ; they maintained the purchasing<lb/>
power of the interest of the government debt ;<lb/>
but they faced a grueling deflationary force in the<lb/>
form of decreased tourist trade and a poor bargaining<lb/>
position in the markets where Swiss exports were sold.<lb/>
<space/>A special kind of pride also influenced Switzerland’s<lb/>
decision not to follow the British into devaluation<lb/>
in 1931. For many centuries the Swiss, lying on<lb/>
the central trading routes of Europe, have served as<lb/>
bankers for the Continent. In modern times Geneva,<lb/>
Basel, and Lausanne carried on this tradition. In the<lb/>
early thirties every political and financial crisis induced<lb/>
a flow of funds to Switzerland from Vienna,<lb/>
Berlin, Paris, and even London. The Swiss were justly<lb/>
proud of the confidence the Continent seemed to<lb/>
place in the franc and wished to justify that confidence.<lb/>

erable influence in the country, and their weight was<lb/>
thrown heavily to the side of financial orthodoxy. In<lb/>
a sense this attitude was quixotic. The whole structure<lb/>
of free trade and free capital movements was<lb/>
crumbling. Switzerland could not, in fact, hold out<lb/>
alone. But to Switzerland’s bankers, to her middle<lb/>
classes, and even to the working population currency<lb/>
devaluation represented a kind of public immorality<lb/>
and it was fought to the end. Towards the close of<lb/>
September, 1937, the gold bloc cracked. Its members<lb/>
realized that they had not fully shared the recovery<lb/>
that less orthodox countries had enjoyed in the period<lb/>
of 1932-1936. Their gold holdings were dwindling,<lb/>
interest rates were high, credit tight, unemployment<lb/>
still rising. France led the way in this capitulation,<lb/>
and the smaller nations were forced to follow<lb/>
her in devaluation. The French franc, however, was<lb/>
reduced in value by sixty per cent and the Swiss franc<lb/>
by a mere thirty per cent—the minimum compatible<lb/>
with an even partial adjustment to world forces.<lb/>
<space/>For Switzerland, devaluation was inevitable once<lb/>
France took the step. The French were the second<lb/>
largest purchasers of Swiss goods after Germany, and<lb/>
exports to France would have been critically affected<lb/>
if Switzerland had stood out. Furthermore, 1936 was<lb/>
for the Swiss a very difficult year. In January, unemployment<lb/>
was as high as nineteen per cent of the<lb/>
working population ; and the unstable monetary situation<lb/>
had led to a large-scale hoarding of gold and a<lb/>

general reluctance to undertake any type of new enterprise.<lb/>
Even under these circumstances a considerable<lb/>
portion of the population opposed devaluation.<lb/>
Action was postponed by the government until the<lb/>
last minute, and the opposition almost succeeded in<lb/>
unseating the President of the Council.<lb/>
<space/>The fear of inflation which was largely back of this<lb/>
opposition proved unfounded. The Swiss devaluation<lb/>
was handled with great skill, and it inflicted a minimum<lb/>
of suffering. Action was immediately taken to<lb/>
prevent a speculative rise in prices and custom duties,<lb/>
and import quotas were lowered in order to insure a<lb/>
plentiful supply of cheap goods. Between 1936 and<lb/>
the outbreak of war in 1939 the rise in Swiss prices<lb/>
was unimportant. Unemployment, moreover, fell<lb/>
steadily, and although export markets and the tourist<lb/>
trade were not fully regained, Switzerland seemed to<lb/>
have emerged with fair success from the crisis.<lb/>

the liberal economic tradition of the nineteenth century<lb/>
the Swiss found a framework ideal for their special<lb/>
organization. The compromise between international<lb/>
co-operation and a federalized nationalism offered<lb/>
by that framework exactly suited the temper<lb/>
and structure of Swiss life. The nation was loath to<lb/>
abandon the forms which once represented the central<lb/>
vitality of the nineteenth-century world.<lb/>
<space/>The lesson of Swiss economy is plain. Neither natural<lb/>
resources nor empire are the true sources of national<lb/>
prosperity and individual well-being. In the<lb/>
face of this established fact the contention of imperialists<lb/>
all over the world that their territorial greeds<lb/>
are motivated by a desire for a higher standard of<lb/>
living for their own people seems singularly hollow.<lb/>
<space/>Swiss economic history proves that a state whose<lb/>
policy is liberal both internally and in the international<lb/>
field may enjoy a prosperity as great as any to<lb/>
be had by nationalistic or totalitarian means. But<lb/>
Switzerland’s well-being and even its survival do depend<lb/>
on the existence of some degree of economic<lb/>
freedom and rational exchange among the nations. In<lb/>
the economic, as in the political field, danger for<lb/>
Switzerland comes from the selfishness of nations that<lb/>
are not willing to earn their way to prosperity by<lb/>
hard work and the use of what resources they have,<lb/>
but which prefer to snatch by force of arms the advantages<lb/>
they desire.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>What the Swiss hope from a reconstituted Europe<lb/>
is a return of the paradox of their pre-war life. They<lb/>
want a maximum of international exchange of goods,<lb/>
a minimum of direct political and cultural interference<lb/>
from the outside. They must send their watches,<lb/>
machinery, lace, and cheeses over the continent. They<lb/>
must receive raw and semi-manufactured goods from<lb/>
the world outside. Borders must be opened for the<lb/>
tourist. Their modern history indicates that this ideal<lb/>
is not impossible of fulfillment. It is power politics,<lb/>
not genuine economic realities, that makes it difficult<lb/>
to attain.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss have more than once adapted their social<lb/>
and economic structure to changing circumstances.<lb/>
They lived successfully in -the midst of the feudal<lb/>
states of the late Middle Ages and with the great<lb/>
mercantilist empires. In a federated Europe, trade<lb/>
agreements made under the auspices of a continentwide<lb/>
organization might be as favorable to them as<lb/>
the status of 1914. They are not, however, prepared<lb/>
to accept conditions that involve the sacrifice of their<lb/>
political independence. They wish for no new order,<lb/>
however profitable, under German hegemony. They<lb/>
have thus far placed their federal integrity above<lb/>
economic advantage, and they will unquestionably<lb/>
continue to do so.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
Tl COUNTRY which has four languages cannot<lb/>
have a homogeneous culture, and if three of these<lb/>
languages belong to great neighboring civilizations,<lb/>
its culture cannot be entirely autonomous. Yet Switzerland<lb/>
has given its artistic and intellectual creations<lb/>
depth and originality, and in certain fields it has produced<lb/>
a remarkable synthesis of Latin and Germanic<lb/>
virtues.<lb/>
<space/>In order to discuss Swiss culture we would have to<lb/>
find something in common between such different<lb/>
spirits as Zwingli, Paracelsus, Euler, Pestalozzi, J. J.<lb/>
Rousseau, Madame de Stael, Gottfried Keller, H. F.<lb/>
Amiel, Karl Barth, C. F. Ramuz, C. G. Jung, to<lb/>
mention only the universally known men of genius<lb/>
that Switzerland has produced. Can this be<lb/>
done ?<lb/>
<space/>Three primary facts must be kept in mind: Switzerland<lb/>
is a small federal democracy ; it is a stark, upland<lb/>
country ; it is a crossroads. These facts eliminate many<lb/>
possibilities which exist elsewhere, but they create<lb/>
others which are to be found in Switzerland alone.<lb/>

large extent predetermined by the physical and political<lb/>
structure of the country.<lb/>
<space/>In this little federal democracy cultural life was<lb/>
never centralized by a court or a capital. The history<lb/>
of ideas in Switzerland could not be described by<lb/>
generations nor by schools, as it is in France. It is the<lb/>
history of a series of cultural centers which have<lb/>
arisen, shone, and died out here and there, simultaneously<lb/>
or successively, according to language, religion,<lb/>
or political and economic vicissitudes. In the<lb/>
Middle Ages the monasteries of German Switzerland—St.<lb/>
Gall, where Notker Le Begue composed his<lb/>
celebrated Gregorian sequences in the ninth century ;<lb/>
Thurgovia, where Germanic mysticism flourished,<lb/>
and later Einsiedeln, of which Zwingli was the abbot<lb/>
—were centers with a European reputation.<lb/>
<space/>In the sixteenth century Basel and Geneva suddenly<lb/>
took on world importance. With Erasmus, Holbein,<lb/>
and the first great printers, Basel became one of<lb/>
the pillars of the humanistic Renaissance. With Calvin<lb/>
and Theodore Beza, Geneva became the fortress<lb/>
of theological reaction against the Renaissance. Zurich<lb/>
had its turn in the eighteenth century. Center of<lb/>
the “Swiss school,” it exercised for several decades a<lb/>
sort of hegemony over German literary life. At the<lb/>
same time French Switzerland became the refusre of<lb/>

quarreled with the Consistory of the Clergy of<lb/>
Geneva to whom Rousseau had just submitted. In<lb/>
Napoleon’s day all the French Intelligentsia migrated<lb/>
to the shores of Lake Leman. A second “Swiss school,”<lb/>
romantic and liberal, was born in the chateau of<lb/>
Coppet under the auspices of Madame de Stael,<lb/>
daughter of the Genevese banker, Necker, who was<lb/>
the last minister of Louis XVI. This circle disappeared<lb/>
with the Restoration. Another one, more<lb/>
austere and theological, soon grew up in Lausanne<lb/>
where the gentle Vinet tried to convert Sainte-Beuve.<lb/>
Another was founded in Basel around the great historian,<lb/>
Jakob Burckhardt, and his young admirer,<lb/>
Nietzsche ; around Bachofen, the theorist of matriarchy ;<lb/>
around the skeptical theologian Overbeck. After<lb/>
the peace of 1919 the splendid early days of the<lb/>
League of Nations revived, for a few years, by its publications,<lb/>
its salons, its international institutions, the<lb/>
influence of Coppet. Zurich became after 1933 the<lb/>
rendezvous of writers exiled by Fascism or Hitlerism,<lb/>
and Basel is today the citadel of the dialectical theologians<lb/>
of the school of Karl Barth, driven out of the<lb/>
German universities.<lb/>
<space/>Obviously each of these centers was created by the<lb/>
conjunction of international spirits with a small<lb/>
milieu having strong local traditions. Switzerland was<lb/>
not merely a sort of hotel for the French, Italians,<lb/>
Germans, and Englishmen who found there a temporary<lb/>
asylum ; all these men mixed with the society of<lb/>

the city which welcomed them, and they made friends<lb/>
with its best minds. They acted, thought, created and<lb/>
learned to live in a framework, and among customs<lb/>
which were wholly republican. Their works show obvious<lb/>
signs of it. Through them Switzerland became<lb/>
a school of western democracy. For centuries she<lb/>
played the part in Europe which the United States,<lb/>
refuge of the exiles of totalitarianism, seems called<lb/>
upon to play in the world of today and tomorrow.<lb/>
<space/>Political federalism implies diverse centers of culture.<lb/>
Moreover in a small democracy—perhaps in any<lb/>
democracy worthy of the name—there must exist a<lb/>
vigorous taste for education, a preoccupation with it.<lb/>
<space/>We have seen that the Swiss is didactic, that he has<lb/>
both the gift and the passion for education. This<lb/>
characteristic is to be found not only among Swiss<lb/>
theologians, moralists and psychologists, but even in<lb/>
the best poets and novelists. Rousseau preached perpetually<lb/>
in all his books ; Albert de Haller, the greatest<lb/>
man Berne produced during the aristocratic period,<lb/>
is best known for a long didactic poem on the<lb/>
Alps ; Jeremia Gotthelf, who was a country clergyman<lb/>
in the nineteenth century, produced a considerable<lb/>
body of novels which are among the finest works of<lb/>
German literature but which are nothins: but a<lb/>
<space/>o<lb/>
vast sermon splendidly illustrated. Even in Green<lb/>
Henry, that masterpiece by Gottfried Keller, the<lb/>
progressive radical of Zurich, there are to be found,<lb/>
side by side with the moving lyrical passages, a quan<lb/>

tity of didactic reflections which draw a moral even<lb/>
from the most fantastic and romantic events.<lb/>
<space/>Thus it is not astonishing that Switzerland gave<lb/>
birth to the greatest pedagogue of modern times:<lb/>
Pestalozzi ; to his Catholic disciple, Father Girard ;<lb/>
and to Rousseau, who in Emile showed himself a<lb/>
realistic and competent precursor of modern educational<lb/>
methods. Even today Switzerland is at the forefront<lb/>
of the educational movement and it is perhaps<lb/>
in this domain that it has shown most daring and<lb/>
most creative imagination. The Rousseau Institute in<lb/>
Geneva, directed by well-known psychologists such as<lb/>
Pierre Bovet, Jean Piaget, and Edouard Claparede,<lb/>
has developed educators from all countries. Its guiding<lb/>
idea is typically Swiss and even federalist ; it is to<lb/>
waken in each individual both a personal initiative<lb/>
and the idea of social service. It is to wish man to be<lb/>
“master of himself in order that he may serve others,”<lb/>
according to Vinet’s maxim.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>A rude land where men live close to each other,<lb/>
but also a land of altitude, where glacial sublimity<lb/>
and daily prose are in close contact: this is the second<lb/>
factor which determines the character of Swiss culture.<lb/>
The material and social conditions of the country<lb/>

craftsmanship, a genius for taking advantage of everything,<lb/>

country itself affords the spectacle of a well-made<lb/>
machine, very complex, but beautifully polished and<lb/>
kept up with scrupulous care. This practical sense,<lb/>
this feeling for economy, this imagination turned towards<lb/>
the knowledge and improvement of reality<lb/>
rather than towards pure speculation are facts which<lb/>
explain why the Swiss have a scientific rather than a<lb/>
poetic spirit. When a Swiss has a great vision, he does<lb/>
not write an eloquent speech nor a passionate poem ;<lb/>
he makes a huge bridge—like the Washington Bridge<lb/>

<space/>Of the seven Nobel prizes which have been<lb/>
awarded to Swiss citizens in these last decades only<lb/>
one went to a poet—Carl Spitteler. The others were<lb/>
given to chemists, doctors, naturalists, or mathematicians.<lb/>
The proportion is significant. In all the centuries<lb/>
cities like Basel and Geneva did not produce a<lb/>
single poet worthy of the name, whereas among their<lb/>
aristocracy real scientific dynasties developed, such as<lb/>
the de Saussures and the Forels in the domain of natural<lb/>
sciences, the Bernouilli and the Burckhardts of<lb/>
Basel in mathematics and history. Neuchatel, a little<lb/>
city of 23,000 inhabitants, has not yet found its writer,<lb/>
but it has given birth to Emer de Vattel, one of the<lb/>
founders of international law, to Osterwald, theologian<lb/>
and translator of the Bible, and to the Agassiz<lb/>
family whose brilliant career America has witnessed.<lb/>

more “play” is necessary—more waste of time and<lb/>
thought, more leisure, solitude and spiritual vagabondage<lb/>
than Switzerland can give or tolerate. It<lb/>
should be added that scientific work, which is essentially<lb/>
collective or co-operative, corresponds to the<lb/>
temper of the country. The Swiss scientist is not<lb/>
merely the man of the laboratory—it is rare that we<lb/>
find him isolating himself in his specialties. In general<lb/>
he is remarkably human, he has a great part in<lb/>
the social, civic, and even religious life of his canton.<lb/>
Thus Leonard Euler, one of the greatest mathematicians<lb/>
of the modern era, spent a large part of his time<lb/>
in defending and illustrating the Christian faith, as<lb/>
his correspondence shows. But if Swiss poetic genius<lb/>
in the broadest sense has found expression rarely and<lb/>
incompletely in poems, it has found compensation in<lb/>
unexpected domains. In this land without plains, cut<lb/>
up into pigeon holes, the imagination can move freely<lb/>
only towards the heights and the depths—whether<lb/>
physically, in looking at the Alps, or symbolically in<lb/>
the regions of the spirit. Moreover this imagination,<lb/>
however far it may go in daring, never ceases to aim<lb/>
at a sort of superior utility. It was not for the sake of<lb/>
fame or sport that the Vaudois Professor, Piccard,<lb/>
went up into stratosphere, but to bring down information<lb/>
as to those regions. Why is it that when he<lb/>

rule that a Swiss writer or artist can reach fame and<lb/>
make his reputation only in a foreign capital. The<lb/>
best Swiss authors are published in Paris, in Milan,<lb/>
or in Berlin. They have almost all of them spent a<lb/>
part of their lives in one or another of these capitals,<lb/>
and it has often happened that they are better known<lb/>
there than in their own canton.<lb/>
<space/>A witty citizen of Geneva, writer of the last century,<lb/>
Marc Monnier, summed up this fecund exchange<lb/>
in a brief talk given before his Paris colleagues.<lb/>
“Messieurs les Franca is,” he said, “you gave<lb/>
us Calvin, we sent you Rousseau. Let us begin again.”<lb/>
<space/>Because of this constant exchange, the Swiss intellectual<lb/>
has become a man given to comparison, a kind<lb/>
of necessary middle-man of culture, a translator in<lb/>
the widest sense of the word. It was a citizen of Berne,<lb/>
Bear de Muralt, whose Letters on the French and<lb/>
English, published at the beginning of the eighteenth<lb/>
century, aroused an interest in England and English<lb/>
affairs on the continent. It was Madame de Stael and<lb/>
Benjamin Constant who revealed the wealth of German<lb/>
thought—Goethe, Schiller and the romantic philosophers—to<lb/>
the post-Napoleonic generation. Charles<lb/>
Maurras, the royalist philosopher and pamphleteer,<lb/>
has frequently inveighed against the little court<lb/>
which gathered around Madame de Stael at Coppet<lb/>
as being at the bottom of all that he hated in republican<lb/>
France, for it was actually through that famous<lb/>
“gap of Coppet,” between the Lake and the Jura, that<lb/>

liberal ideas entered the Latin world. It was two Swiss<lb/>
historians, Philippe Monnier and Jakob Burckhardt,<lb/>
who revived knowledge and appreciation of the Italian<lb/>
Renaissance in the nineteenth century, the first by<lb/>
a charming “Quatro-cento,” the second by a monumental<lb/>
work on the spirit of the Renaissance which<lb/>
greatly influenced Nietzsche and through him<lb/>
touched a large part of contemporary thought.<lb/>
<space/>It should astonish no one to find that France discovered<lb/>
foreign contemporary literatures through the<lb/>
intermediary of Swiss critics and Swiss magazines. We<lb/>
will mention here among many possible names only<lb/>
those of Maurice Muret, whose books on Germany<lb/>
and Italy were considered authoritative even before<lb/>
1914, and of Robert de Traz, the founder of the<lb/>
Revue de Geneve, which after the peace of 1919 reflected<lb/>
the spirit of the early days of the League of<lb/>
Nations. To it most of the political men of the day<lb/>
contributed, and in its pages were first published in<lb/>
translation the works of Thomas Mann, D. H. Lawrence,<lb/>
Katherine Mansfield, Ortega y Gasset, Sherwood<lb/>
Anderson, Virginia Woolf, Keyserling, and<lb/>
Pirandello.<lb/>
What we have said heretofore may give the impression<lb/>
that Swiss culture tends to create high averages<lb/>
rather than exceptional individuals. That is true. But<lb/>
whereas this kind of fundamental though unformulated<lb/>
law of Swiss democracy has no exception on the<lb/>

civic level (the great art of the Swiss political man is<lb/>
to efface himself) , it is remarkable that in the domain<lb/>
of culture powerful personalities have succeeded in<lb/>
reaching full development. It is true that often they<lb/>
have been recognized and adopted by their compatriots<lb/>
only after they have made their mark on<lb/>
wider stages abroad. Take, for example, some of the<lb/>
most remarkable Swiss of today: Ferdinand Hodler,<lb/>
C. F. Ramuz, Blaise Cendrars, C. G. Jung, Karl Barth,<lb/>
Emile Jaques-Dalcroze and Arthur Honegger.<lb/>
<space/>Ferdinand Hodler died in 1918, at the age of 65<lb/>
years, but his influence still dominates almost all living<lb/>
Swiss painting. His was doubtless the most authentically<lb/>
native genius that Switzerland has produced<lb/>
in the contemporary period, the one which<lb/>
owes least to foreign influences. His real masters were<lb/>
the soldier-painters of the Renaissance and the Swiss<lb/>
Reformation, a Niklaus Manuel Deutsch, and an<lb/>
Urs Graf. It is in their exact tradition but in vastly<lb/>
greater proportions, and in a style that has been<lb/>
brutally simplified, that Hodler composed his warrior<lb/>
frescoes and his athletic allegories. He was a great<lb/>
landscapist (especially of the Alps) and a pitiless portrait<lb/>
painter, but it is when he portrays the Halberdiers<lb/>
of the Wars of Italy that he reaches his grandest<lb/>
form. Nothing today gives us so direct a sensation of<lb/>
the force of the old Confederates as the warriors of<lb/>
Marignano, shortlegged, thick and square, lowering<lb/>
their foreheads like bulls before the attack.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>The prose of C. T. Ramuz has often been compared<lb/>
with the painting of Cezanne and of the Cubists, but<lb/>
in fact it is far more like the deliberate stylizing of<lb/>
Hodler. Ramuz is without any doubt the greatest living<lb/>
Swiss writer and one of the greatest French writers<lb/>
of our times. His novels seem to be tragedies of<lb/>
peasant life or epics of alpine villages, but they are<lb/>
not in the least the product of “naturalism” or “regionalism.”<lb/>
His method is to reduce everything to a<lb/>
symbol or myth ; psychological analysis is replaced by<lb/>
a description of forms and of motions, according to a<lb/>
technique which recalls that of the old silent films<lb/>
where atmosphere and gesture told the story without<lb/>
commentary. Ramuz lived in Paris for many years,<lb/>
alone, misunderstood, but laboring to forge himself<lb/>
an absolutely original style, one slow, rocky, full of<lb/>
pauses and new departures, like the gait of a man<lb/>
who climbs a steep slope. The war of 1914 brought<lb/>
him back to his native canton of Vaud, which he had<lb/>
always described in his books, but where he was read<lb/>
only after Paris publishers and critics gave him a<lb/>
reputation.<lb/>
<space/>In spite of Ramuz’s extreme modernism it is easy<lb/>
to trace his Swiss origins in his work. The taste for<lb/>
physical things, the fascinating descriptions of tools<lb/>
and their handling, the restraint of his novels, where<lb/>
the greatest passions express themselves in the smallest<lb/>
gestures, the solid construction of his books, all<lb/>
these are the qualities of a race at once Protestant<lb/>

and closely bound to the soil. Ramuz’s influence has<lb/>
constantly grown both in his own country and in<lb/>
France. In his house by Lake Leman he receives literary<lb/>
pilgrims every day—but he hates to be interviewed,<lb/>
and he amuses himself by bombarding his<lb/>
visitors with questions, apparently naive, about themselves<lb/>
and their way of life. This is a real peasant’s<lb/>
trick—but it has made of Ramuz one of the best and<lb/>
most curiously informed men of this era.<lb/>
<space/>Blaise Cendrars (his real name is Fritz Sauser-Hall) <lb/>
was born in Switzerland, although very few people<lb/>
are aware of it. He is the antithesis of Ramuz, for he<lb/>
is the eternal emigre, the lyrical nomad. In former<lb/>
days he would have enlisted in one of the regiments<lb/>
of the foreign service. During the first world war he<lb/>
fought with the Foreign Legion and lost an arm. He<lb/>
writes his books by means of a dictaphone, and we<lb/>
have seen him roll a cigarette with his left hand on<lb/>
the platform of a Paris bus.<lb/>
<space/>He invented modern French poetry before Apollinaire<lb/>
and the surrealists—see his book Easter in New<lb/>
York. He introduced Negro folklore to Europe,<lb/>
wrote novels of adventure and epic pieces of newspaper<lb/>
reporting, and he has known all the world’s<lb/>
adventurers. Today he represents the Swiss “irregulars.”<lb/>
Irrepressible and hard-boiled, neither teacher<lb/>
nor moralist, but a poet, and a poet of the most extravagant<lb/>
action, he recalls the turbulent geniuses of<lb/>
the Swiss Renaissance such as Dr. Paracelsus, who<lb/>

wandered across Europe from inn to university, followed<lb/>
by his band of quarrelsome disciples, or Nik-<lb/>
laus Manuel Deutsch, who was alternately painter,<lb/>
warrior, playwright and statesman. Like them and<lb/>
like Honegger in music, he has the gift of creative<lb/>
improvisation, based however on a sound technique<lb/>
and shrewd practical sense.<lb/>
<space/>Carl Gustav Jung is too well known in America<lb/>
to need lengthy introduction. His work as a psychoanalyst<lb/>
overflows that of Freud, which it corrects and<lb/>
enriches. It has turned more and more towards a kind<lb/>
of religious quest. Jung is a doctor and a professor,<lb/>
but he has an intimate knowledge of the religions of<lb/>
Africa and the Orient, which he studied on the spot.<lb/>
He made himself a Negro sorcerer for some months,<lb/>
and his enemies call him a white sorcerer today. His<lb/>
great discovery has been that of “constant symbols”<lb/>
or “archetypes,” which his immense knowledge and<lb/>
a kind of poetical intuition led him to recognize in<lb/>
the rites and mysteries of cults in every time and land,<lb/>
in the dreams of his patients, and in the “collective<lb/>
subconscious” of our epoch. Jung’s varied fields of<lb/>
investigation and his synthetic spirit ally him to a<lb/>
whole line of explorers of the occult: Paracelsus,<lb/>
Lavater, the romantic I. V. Troxler, Bachofen, and<lb/>
H. F. Amiel, author of the Journal which is the<lb/>
monstrous masterpiece of introspection. In these men<lb/>

sion—a passionate interest in man as a moral being<lb/>
and a religious animal.<lb/>
<space/>The theology of Karl Barth might be characterized<lb/>
grosso modo as a reaction against this religious psychology<lb/>
and against the Protestant liberalism of the<lb/>
last two centuries in general. It opposes to them the<lb/>
massive affirmation—alpine, one might say—of a Christianity<lb/>
centered not on religious feeling and the insatiable<lb/>
and uncertain needs of the human heart, but<lb/>
upon God the “utterly different.” In his own way,<lb/>
Barth is a great fighter, a Swiss warrior of the early<lb/>
days. His “commentary on the Epistle to the Romans”<lb/>
which he wrote for his personal use while he<lb/>
was the clergyman of a village near the Rhine during<lb/>
the war of 1914 was published by a few friends just<lb/>
after the war. Its success was immediate, and it produced<lb/>
a deep impression throughout intellectual Germany.<lb/>
Barth was utterly amazed by this. He felt himself,<lb/>
he said, to be like a man who in the darkness of<lb/>
a belfry staircase clutches at the bannister to guide<lb/>
himself and finds that he has pulled the bell-rope and<lb/>
brought together all the congregation !<lb/>
<space/>Appointed to a professorship in Germany he became<lb/>
in spite of himself the head of a school of<lb/>
thought. Barth brought about in ten years or so a revival<lb/>
of the orthodoxy of the Reformers which wakened<lb/>
Protestant thought throughout the world. It is<lb/>
on the basis of a doctrine drawn from his teachings<lb/>
and his direct action that the German Confessional<lb/>

Church (.Bekenntniskirche) was founded. Today with<lb/>
its 6,000 clergyman it is the rampart of inner resistance<lb/>
to pagan Hitlerism. A year after the Fuhrer<lb/>
came to power, Barth was called before the law-courts<lb/>
and deprived of his professorship. He was accused of<lb/>
having spoken against the regime in private homes.<lb/>
His only defense was to read to his judges the “Farewell<lb/>
of Socrates.” In the spring of 1940 when the German<lb/>
threat to Switzerland became acute he enlisted<lb/>
as a volunteer in the auxiliary services, although he<lb/>
was fifty-four years old. Barth is considered by Catholics<lb/>
as well as Protestants to be the greatest living<lb/>
theologian. He is of the race of the Reformers, and in<lb/>
stature he is not unworthy of them.<lb/>
<space/>In Emile Jacques-Dalcroze we find the good-humored<lb/>
and fantastic side of the Swiss, or more precisely<lb/>
of the French Swiss, character. Dalcroze is<lb/>
known everywhere as the creator of a new method of<lb/>
teaching music, the “rhythmic,” in which the whole<lb/>
body is used, and harmony of sound is translated by<lb/>
that of motion. Dalcroze Institutes exist in every<lb/>
capital, and the one in New York is particularly flourishing.<lb/>
But “Monsieur Jaques,” as his friends call<lb/>
him, is also a prolific composer, and the author of<lb/>
several hundred songs, some patriotic, some sentimental,<lb/>
some written for children, which are extremely<lb/>
popular in Switzerland and in France. In music and<lb/>
words alike he has known how to express the easygoing<lb/>
humor, and the deep feeling for nature of the<lb/>

French-Swiss college student that he has never ceased<lb/>
to be. Dalcroze’s songs have already become a part of<lb/>
the folklore of Switzerland. You hear them in schools,<lb/>
in student clubs, in alpine huts, on the roads, and<lb/>
around the fires which are lit on the first of August<lb/>
on the heights to commemorate the oath of the Riitli.<lb/>
There are few examples of an artistic career which<lb/>
has been so intimately blended with the life of a<lb/>
whole people, which has become so national, during<lb/>
the life of the composer.<lb/>
<space/>Many people are unaware that Dalcroze is a composer,<lb/>
but still more fail to realize that Arthur Honegger<lb/>
is Swiss. He was, in fact, born in Le Havre,<lb/>
and has spent a large part of his life in France, but<lb/>
he was a Swiss soldier, and he speaks the dialect of<lb/>
his own canton fluently. His music itself attests a<lb/>
certain fundamental Helvetianism by its solid proportions<lb/>
and its sincerity. The biblical inspiration of<lb/>
his oratorios is itself a Swiss trait. Did not Ramuz<lb/>
once say that the Bible is the real “antiquity” of that<lb/>
country, much more living for its inhabitants than<lb/>
the Gallo-Roman past ? What differentiates Honegger<lb/>
from other contemporary musicians is a basic equilibrium—of<lb/>
which he gives an impression physically—<lb/>
and an almost classic conception of creation in art.<lb/>
No one is less prone to yield to undisciplined inspiration,<lb/>
no one knows better how to use the limitations<lb/>
imposed by surrounding conditions, such as the size<lb/>
of the work required and the public for which it is<lb/>

written. His sure craftsmanship has led him to attempt<lb/>
the most varied kinds of production ; oratorios,<lb/>
operas, chamber music, music for the cinema, without<lb/>
becoming stiff, or allowing technique to stifle<lb/>
emotion. His world-wide reputation is due in part to<lb/>
his most doubtful work, “Pacific 231,” but it is in<lb/>
choral music that he has produced masterpieces, and<lb/>
particularly in the series of oratorios from “King<lb/>
David” to “Nicholas de Flue.” This may be because<lb/>
in them he returns to the great communal tradition<lb/>
of Swiss art, that of the Festival, which merits a separate<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
SWITZERLAND has given the world of art no individuals<lb/>
of absolutely first rank, as Holland gave it<lb/>
Rembrandt, and Saxony, Bach. But it has created an<lb/>
artistic genre which is original and in which it excels<lb/>
because this genre translates the communal genius<lb/>
of the Confederation and illustrates the very raison<lb/>
d’etre of that State. This is the Festival, or Festspiele.<lb/>
<space/>It is sometimes thought that the jodel is the typically<lb/>
Swiss art form. But the jodel is typical of Switzerland<lb/>
only in the way in which the Negro spirituals<lb/>
may be said to be typical of the United States. It is<lb/>
not so much a Swiss specialty as a bizarrerie. It exists<lb/>
only in certain regions of Switzerland, and it is also<lb/>
to be found in many other countries—even in Thibet.<lb/>
<space/>Paul Budry writes: “If Switzerland has created anything<lb/>
original it is the jodel. In its very design, in its<lb/>
wide intervals, in its rising notes and its lace-work<lb/>
of tones the jodel seems to reproduce the configuration<lb/>
of the Alps whose echoes it rouses.” 1 But the<lb/>
same writer admits that the jodel is alpine rather<lb/>
than Swiss. “It expresses the pure exuberance, the<lb/>

In the mountains of India our Ruguusser2 are sung<lb/>

the path of the jodel across the continents, as it<lb/>
moves from altitude to altitude at the height of the<lb/>
upper pasturages.” The jodel, of which tradition tells<lb/>
as early as the fourth century of our era, before the<lb/>
Christianization of Switzerland, was probably at first<lb/>
a magical invocation, not an art.<lb/>
<space/>‘‘These airs with their continual high and low<lb/>

begins as it were to wink on a trill, their descending<lb/>
chromatic cascades, gliding like an eagle from the<lb/>
heights to the depths—their pattern, which the singer<lb/>
varies at will by different vocal tonalities ; bellowings,<lb/>
clarinet-like nasal sounds, violin-like scrapings, which<lb/>
are accompanied by the sound of a mouth organ or<lb/>
of a coin shaken in a bowl, are obviously intended,<lb/>
like all primitive chants, to daze the public, and conjure<lb/>
away something—silence, fear, solitude, a demon,<lb/>
or the terror of Man exposed in the loneliness of the<lb/>
Alps to the menace of the air. He sings—he sings<lb/>
frantically with all his might, shaking his little bells<lb/>
to ward off present terror. The jodel is a creation of<lb/>

You will find the jodel, together with the alpine horn,<lb/>

most of the jodels which are sung in foreign countries<lb/>
or registered for the phonograph are mild and disciplined<lb/>
versions of the authentic “roaring” which is<lb/>
improvised with endless variety by the herdsmen of<lb/>
Appenzell.<lb/>
<space/>The Festival is, on the contrary, an historical art<lb/>
form, which has developed slowly in the course of a<lb/>
long evolution. It expresses in a high degree the soul<lb/>
and the common customs of the whole Swiss people.<lb/>
“The Festival may be defined as a work created by<lb/>
and for the people. This means that it must appeal<lb/>
to the people as a whole, and that the executants must<lb/>
be drawn from among the population itself. The necessary<lb/>
artistic elements are an important musical<lb/>
score, a brilliant setting, many participants, games<lb/>
and perhaps dances.”<lb/>
<space/>The stage of a Festival is built especially for the occasion,<lb/>
and is made of several parts or levels connected<lb/>
by broad stairways, in order to allow the free<lb/>
movement of actors and choruses. Often as many as<lb/>
four or five hundred, perhaps a thousand or more,<lb/>
persons take part. The Vaudois Festival of 1903 included<lb/>
2,500 actors. These Festivals are given as a<lb/>

rule out of doors or else in improvised tents, and<lb/>
huge crowds come to them. They are almost always<lb/>
given to celebrate a patriotic anniversary or some special<lb/>
event of cantonal or Federal significance, such as<lb/>
an Exhibition, a great shooting match, or a meeting<lb/>
of gymnastic or choral societies. There is almost no<lb/>
celebration of any importance, civic or religious,<lb/>
which does not give rise to a Festival composed by a<lb/>
poet and a musician for that special occasion.<lb/>
<space/>The authors have a new problem to work out each<lb/>
time, for in preparing their work they must consider<lb/>
on the one hand the resources of the canton or city<lb/>
which has requested their services, and on the other<lb/>
the historical or allegorical significance of the particular<lb/>
festivity. Whether it is the memory of a battle<lb/>

certain historical accuracy is required of the playwright,<lb/>

with the subject, and will want to see the traditional<lb/>
events and characters on the stage. The choral groups<lb/>
play a part rather like that of the choruses in Greek<lb/>
tragedy ; they comment on the action, express in lyrical<lb/>
form the feelings of the public, and represent in<lb/>
contrast to the individual heroes the collective element,<lb/>
the crowd, which is sometimes a spectator,<lb/>

are always amateurs, the budget allowed for decoration<lb/>
and costumes are so many factors which the poet<lb/>
and even the musician must take into account. These<lb/>
vary greatly from one canton to another. The authors<lb/>
always work in close collaboration with the local committees<lb/>
which are in charge of the Festival, and which<lb/>
are supposed to raise the money, choose the actors and<lb/>
give the celebration the necessary official sanction. It<lb/>
is obvious that these Festivals are genuinely communal<lb/>
creations. The work is done by groups, and<lb/>
it makes use of all the resources of the place where it<lb/>
is given. It requires an enthusiastic co-operation, and<lb/>
often when the subject is historical it brings about a<lb/>
sort of truce among the political parties.<lb/>
<space/>But the composition of a Festival is not entirely arbitrary.<lb/>
This type of creation has its own laws, which<lb/>
can be traced back to its origins. The Festival was<lb/>
probably born from the conjunction of two distinct<lb/>
parts which had each followed a parallel evolution:<lb/>
the procession and the cantata.<lb/>
<space/>It has been said that the Swiss have processions in<lb/>
the blood. They love their local costumes, and they<lb/>
like to wear the clothes and armor of their ancestors<lb/>
in public on great occasions. To do so is not a masquerade<lb/>
nor a carnival, but the plastic representation<lb/>
of a past which to them is still very living. They<lb/>
go to the Landesgemeinde, their congress, in a procession,<lb/>
and the meeting is carried on like a drama—<lb/>
or rather like one of the old mystery plays of the<lb/>

Middle Ages. The procession reaches the market<lb/>
place and forms the “ring,” a circle symbolic of the<lb/>
Alliance. The ceremony is opened and closed by<lb/>
prayer, the alternating speeches of the orators form a<lb/>
sort of dramatic dialogue, and the applause or protests<lb/>
of the crowd give a first idea of the spoken<lb/>
chorus. There we have the elements of the Festival.<lb/>
<space/>The Fete des Vignerons, which is given every<lb/>
twenty-five years at Vevey, also originated in a procession,<lb/>
that of the workers in the vineyards going to<lb/>
get their official rewards. Little by little in the course<lb/>
of the eighteenth century, this procession was enriched<lb/>
by allegorical personages such as Bacchus, the<lb/>
goddesses Ceres and Pallas, groups of harvesters and<lb/>
bacchantes, representing the seasons. From 1778 on,<lb/>
the procession stopped at one place or another to<lb/>
show the public the popular dances. Later it was<lb/>
brought into an arena where a sort of ordered game<lb/>
took place. Musical interludes soon appeared, and a<lb/>
poet was requested to write the words of the songs<lb/>
and invocations. The Festival thus reached its ultimate<lb/>
form, which has not changed since the beginning<lb/>
of the nineteenth century.<lb/>
<space/>Music was, of course, essential for the expression of<lb/>
collective emotions, and the Swiss love of choral singing,<lb/>
the numerous Mannerchor (male choruses) which<lb/>
exist in the villages, furnish the composers with the<lb/>
necessary resources. “Put two Swiss together,” says<lb/>
Paul Budry, “and the second will at once strike up<lb/>

a bass. This is Swiss polyphony, the natural<lb/>
music of our mystical federation. Weak when it is a<lb/>
question of melody alone, our song takes on its full<lb/>
meaning when the voices are polyphonic.”<lb/>
<space/>But the Festival is not only a federal art by its<lb/>
origins and its laws but also by its social function.<lb/>
In fact, it is a much-needed element in the formation<lb/>
of the civic consciousness of Swiss democracy. No<lb/>
human society worthy of the name can do without<lb/>
celebrations. That is what the totalitarians have so<lb/>
well understood in our day, after centuries of individualism<lb/>
in which the social bond had become dangerously<lb/>
loose because of the lack of common symbols,<lb/>
common emotions, and the common celebration of<lb/>
the great memories and enduring values of the nation.<lb/>
But totalitarian celebrations are almost always<lb/>
sad, with a military and geometrical appearance. The<lb/>
crowds watch them, but can only take part in them<lb/>
by mechanically rhythmic cheers.<lb/>
<space/>The Festival, on the contrary, puts on the stage<lb/>
highly individual heroes, known and loved by the<lb/>
people whose ideal of liberty they incarnate. These<lb/>
heroes are not surrounded by anonymous and rigidly<lb/>
disciplined performers, but by choruses with whom<lb/>
they dialogue and communicate—that is to say, by<lb/>
real communities. Each of these Festivals is a great<lb/>
patriotic event in the canton. Special trains bring the<lb/>

chief political authorities and the officers of the highest<lb/>

press gives free publicity, and comments at length on<lb/>

of the region is enriched by the songs and music,<lb/>

modern democracies should draw from it if they want<lb/>

for the theater of the city, which is born in<lb/>

monastery of central Switzerland, where they present<lb/>
each year a certain number of great plays, such as<lb/>

Henry Gottfried Keller describes a performance of<lb/>
Schiller’s “Wilhelm Tell” by the population of the<lb/>
primitive cantons. It was played not only out of doors<lb/>
but in “all the country,” that is to say in the very<lb/>
places where Schiller, according to history, had placed<lb/>
the legendary action of the hero. Bands of peasants in<lb/>
costume, some on foot, others on horseback, wander<lb/>
through the regions around the Lake of the<lb/>
Four Cantons. At the given moment Tell meets the<lb/>
bailiff, Gessler, in the hollow road of Kiissnacht. At<lb/>
last everyone assembles on the meadow of the Riitli<lb/>
for the scene of the oath. After this they light a beacon-fire,<lb/>
as did the first Confederates on August 1,1291,<lb/>
and soon thousands of fires glow on every mountain<lb/>

IX. THE ARMY OF A DEMOCRACY<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
1HE United States is today face to face with an<lb/>
urgent problem ; it is that of defending democracy<lb/>
without losing its essence, without falling into totalitarianism<lb/>
by way of militarization.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland is the one country in the world which<lb/>
has solved the problem, and every American should<lb/>
be familiar with its example, not necessarily to imitate<lb/>
it, but to find there possibilities, suggestions, and<lb/>
perhaps a new confidence. Here are the facts:<lb/>
<space/>First, Switzerland is the best armed democracy in<lb/>
the world. With a population of 4,300,000 souls, it<lb/>
keeps up an army of nearly 600,000 men. This means<lb/>
that one out of every seven inhabitants becomes a<lb/>
soldier on the day of general mobilization. The same<lb/>
proportion would give the United States an army of<lb/>
about 20,000,000 men.<lb/>
<space/>Second, nowhere are customs and institutions more<lb/>
genuinely democratic than in Switzerland, and yet<lb/>
nowhere is the Army more popular, more essentially<lb/>
a part of civic life.<lb/>
<space/>These two facts can be explained by the military<lb/>
and civic tradition of the cantons and by the federal<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
structure which they have been able to preserve down<lb/>
to our own times. The example of Switzerland shows<lb/>
that a democracy in our days can be militarily strong<lb/>
only if it is openly and thoroughly democratic, even<lb/>
in the details of its organization and its political<lb/>
habits.<lb/>
<space/>Shortly before the war of 1914 the Emperor William<lb/>
II paid an official visit to the Swiss government.<lb/>
While assisting at the military maneuvers, he said to<lb/>
one of the soldiers, “You are 500,000, and you shoot<lb/>
well, but if we attack you with a million men, what<lb/>
will you do ?” “We will each fire twice,” answered<lb/>
the soldier calmly. The Kaiser preferred to pass<lb/>
through Belgium.<lb/>
<space/>An interesting anthology could be made of the<lb/>
tributes paid to the military value of the Swiss by<lb/>
heads of States and great captains from Louis XIV<lb/>
and Frederick II to Napoleon. Such a book would<lb/>
be all the more surprising in that the name of Switzerland<lb/>
is associated for us in modern times with the<lb/>
idea of peace. The flag which bears a red cross on a<lb/>
white ground has made us forget the flag with a white<lb/>
cross on a red ground, from which it originated. Was<lb/>
it not because Switzerland was always able to defend<lb/>
its independence by arms that it gave birth to the<lb/>
pacific work of the Red Cross ?<lb/>
<space/>From the earliest times the Swiss were free because<lb/>
they were strong, but also, as we shall see, they were<lb/>
strong only because they were free. Civil liberty and<lb/>

a military spirit not only have never been in contradiction<lb/>
in that country but rather they have created<lb/>
each other. What is the secret of this curious paradox ?<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>To understand it, we must go back to one of the<lb/>
oldest customs of the Germanic Middle Ages. At that<lb/>
time the “free man,” that is to say the man who enjoyed<lb/>
civil rights and was not the serf of a lord, was<lb/>
distinguished by one fact—he had the right to carry<lb/>
arms—just as the nobles were later distinguished by<lb/>
the wearing of a sword. From the moment that the<lb/>
Swiss communes first freed themselves from the yoke<lb/>
of the Barons and came to depend only on the Imperial<lb/>
Crown the proportion of free men became<lb/>
large. The Swiss valued their weapons as tokens of<lb/>
their liberty. Since then and throughout the centuries<lb/>
their army has always been a gathering of free<lb/>
citizens, each of whom possesses his own arms and<lb/>
proudly cares for his rifle, his ammunition, and his<lb/>
military equipment. In Switzerland one often sees in<lb/>
the poorer neighborhoods uniforms hanging out on<lb/>
the balcony to be “aired,” or a peasant sitting on the<lb/>
threshold of his farmhouse polishing and greasing his<lb/>
gun after the Sunday sharp-shooting. You will see<lb/>
this nowhere else in the world, for Switzerland is the<lb/>
only country where this medieval custom has lasted<lb/>
without interruption down to our own day.<lb/>
<space/>The possession by each citizen of his own individual<lb/>
weapon shows in the most concrete possible way<lb/>
</p>
      </div>

        <p rend="block big">
that the State trusts its citizens absolutely and that<lb/>
they have reached a degree of civic maturity unrivaled<lb/>
elsewhere. Imagine what would happen in<lb/>
certain modern States torn by social or political struggle<lb/>
if the demobilized soldiers were allowed to take<lb/>
home their arms and their ammunition ! In France<lb/>
after the Armistice of 1940 the soldiers were offered<lb/>
1,000 francs in exchange for their rifles for fear of<lb/>
revolutionary troubles. Hitler had his own shock<lb/>
troops disarmed after the purge of June 30, 1934,<lb/>
leaving them only a decorative dagger. Even in America<lb/>
the theft of arms from one of the arsenals of the<lb/>
militia was a source of grave anxiety.<lb/>
<space/>But the possession of individual weapons is not<lb/>
only a sign of freedom and responsibility ; it also has<lb/>
a technical importance which the present war has<lb/>
shown to be considerable. It is the only method which<lb/>
permits of an ultra-rapid and decentralized mobilization.<lb/>
Thus medieval custom has become the most<lb/>
modern method of defense, the one best fitted to protect<lb/>
a country against a Blitzkrieg.<lb/>
<space/>In France as in Germany when people speak of the<lb/>
Army the word brings a vision of a world wholly<lb/>
alien to civilian life. The Swiss do not say “the<lb/>
Army” but rather “the military,” as though they<lb/>
were speaking of one part of their normal lives, the<lb/>
military one. To hear the French, at least before this<lb/>
war, the Army and the time spent in it were fit subjects<lb/>
for jokes and for grumbling. It was against the<lb/>

life of barracks and against the adjutant that the<lb/>
French citizen, even if he was conservative and antipacifist,<lb/>
exercised his individualistic spirit, his refusal<lb/>
to be overawed by collective discipline. In Germany,<lb/>
on the contrary, the Army was something solemn<lb/>
and sacred, a sort of weighty religion which<lb/>
could endure no hint of skepticism.<lb/>
<space/>For the Swiss the Army is simply “service” and that<lb/>
is how they refer to the time spent in the school of<lb/>
recruits and in the “rehearsal periods,” the annual<lb/>
schools of training and maneuvers lasting four weeks<lb/>
which are required of all mobilizable men. Simply<lb/>
“the service.” The expression itself is very enlightening<lb/>
as to the conception which the citizens of this<lb/>
democracy have of their military duties. They do not<lb/>
take them tragically nor do they make fun of them.<lb/>
They are simply a part of their lives just as are their<lb/>
professions or their families.<lb/>
<space/>When Swiss men meet, whether it is in a cafe, a<lb/>
train, or some foreign city where accident has brought<lb/>
them together, you may be sure that as an opening<lb/>
and in order to make better acquaintance they will<lb/>
at once ask each other about their “service.” “The<lb/>
last stage I made in the Army was in the plain of<lb/>
Seeland—you know—the big maneuvers of the second<lb/>
division in 1934 when the Colonel was taken prisoner.”<lb/>
“Oh,” says the other, “I was there, too ! I belong<lb/>
to the 204th battalion—Major Schmidt. You<lb/>
know him ? What is your battalion ?” And dates are<lb/>

compared and the good old classical jokes, as well<lb/>
known as the words of command, are trotted out.<lb/>
One always ends by finding common acquaintances in<lb/>
the service. Confidence is established and the second<lb/>
round of drinks ordered.<lb/>
<space/>But the Army is a bond not only between individuals,<lb/>
but also between classes. Switzerland has no exclusive<lb/>
schools for officers such as the cadet schools<lb/>
in Germany, St. Cyr in France or West Point in<lb/>
America. All young men of twenty who are fit for<lb/>
service must attend the same school of recruits even<lb/>
though they are destined some day to rise to the<lb/>
highest rank. There, during four months of intensive<lb/>
technical and moral training, they live through a<lb/>
social experience which will leave its mark on them<lb/>
for the rest of their lives. The peasant has for roommate<lb/>
or neighbor in the ranks the spectacled student ;<lb/>
the workman has the son of his boss. During four<lb/>
months of ordeals and fatigues there is time to watch<lb/>
each other, to discover the real strength and weakness<lb/>
of one’s neighbors and to make a few lasting friendships.<lb/>
A complete, though sometimes rather cross-<lb/>
grained, equality exists in the barracks, and often<lb/>
manifests itself as at school in practical jokes played<lb/>
on the young man of good family or on the nephew<lb/>
of the Colonel in command. This education, rough<lb/>
enough, and accompanied by a physical training<lb/>
methodically carried on, sends these men back to<lb/>
civilian life quite visibly transformed ; straightened,<lb/>

bronzed, hardened, yet made supple, endowed also<lb/>
with an experience of men which the over-peaceful<lb/>
life of the city or village would not have given them<lb/>
in ten years.<lb/>
<space/>This system of a school of recruits with its periods<lb/>
of brief but intensive training seems to have notable<lb/>
advantages over that practiced elsewhere, of one to<lb/>
three years’ service in barracks or camps. Because the<lb/>
time is short the recruits are not allowed to lose a<lb/>
minute. Whereas the two years of military instruction<lb/>
are too often a school of demoralization and of<lb/>
lost time for young Frenchmen, these four months of<lb/>
the school of recruits are a powerful tonic for Swiss<lb/>
youths and the model of a swift and well-ordered life<lb/>
in which one’s forces are used to the utmost all the<lb/>
time. On the other hand the shortness of the period<lb/>
allows each recruit to find his place in civilian life<lb/>
waiting for him when he goes back, which would not<lb/>
be the case after one or two years. Thus one of the<lb/>
major reasons for the unpopularity of army life in<lb/>
other countries disappears.<lb/>
<space/>As to the technical insufficiency which must result<lb/>
from so brief a period of service, it is to a large extent<lb/>
compensated for by the yearly period of rehearsal.<lb/>
Some experts, and even some Swiss politicians,<lb/>
have for years demanded a prolongation of the<lb/>
school of recruits, but until now popular opinion has<lb/>
opposed this. The Swiss like the military life but they<lb/>
are not militaristic. Instinctively they fear everything<lb/>

that might make of the Army too technical a body<lb/>
and one too remote from the normal life of the<lb/>
nation.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss Army is organized so as to “decivilize”<lb/>
the citizen as little as possible, but on the other hand<lb/>
civilian life brings him frequent and living contacts<lb/>
with military affairs. There are in every canton<lb/>
“friendly circles” of officers and non-commissioned<lb/>
officers ; in every village shooting clubs exist. Many<lb/>
of these associations, and particularly those of noncommissioned<lb/>
officers, have acquired a certain political<lb/>
influence in the country. But it must be emphasized<lb/>
that this influence is not “militaristic.” Such<lb/>
groups are rather like the public discussion clubs<lb/>
which exist in other democracies. To have been in<lb/>
the Army, to have common memories of it, is the<lb/>
pretext for getting together among comrades to discuss<lb/>
the affairs of the country in an atmosphere saner<lb/>
and more virile than that of political parties. Thus<lb/>
these “friendly societies,” far from being Fascist centers<lb/>
as might be feared, have up to now had a stabilizing<lb/>
and moderating influence on public life.<lb/>
<space/>As for the body of officers, it is not at all a caste,<lb/>
as it has tended to become in other countries. The<lb/>
very method of recruiting prohibits that. The Swiss<lb/>
officer is in most cases a civilian like the rest except<lb/>
that this civilian must be able to become a leader<lb/>
from one day to the next and to command his men<lb/>

in the maneuvers. This happens every year at the<lb/>
time of the rehearsal period.<lb/>
<space/>In between times, he must give several hours a<lb/>
week from his professional occupations to the many<lb/>
duties of his military rank. A Captain, for instance,<lb/>
still looks after his company in civilian life. He always<lb/>
knows where his men live. A scrupulously observed<lb/>
custom requires them to send him their good<lb/>
wishes at the New Year and these he always answers.<lb/>
Many of them turn to him for advice or for help in<lb/>
finding work. All consider him as the head of a big<lb/>
family of 200 men.<lb/>
<space/>The daily press, the magazines, the illustrated papers<lb/>
give a great deal of space to military affairs, a<lb/>
fact which always strikes foreigners. Reporters accompany<lb/>
the troops at each rehearsal period and send detailed<lb/>
accounts of the maneuvers from day to day to<lb/>
their papers. The nomination of officers is given<lb/>
space on the first page, and Swiss death notices always<lb/>
tell the details of a man’s military career. Thus, we<lb/>
may discover that such and such a judge, doctor, university<lb/>
professor, or big business man was also a<lb/>
Colonel, which means that he had voluntarily dedicated<lb/>
several years of his life to the Army.<lb/>
<space/>To be a Colonel in Switzerland is to occupy a position<lb/>
which has no equivalent in other countries, one<lb/>
social as well as military, and which might be said to<lb/>
be a civic function. A man who has reached the rank<lb/>

<space/>A particular case will illustrate the above. It is that<lb/>

Colonel, for there is a certain republican mistrust of<lb/>
too sonorous names. Only when the mobilization is<lb/>

commanding an Army corps to be General-in-<lb/>

of the Army, the first citizen and the most important<lb/>
person in the country. The twenty-two cantonal governments<lb/>
in turn invite him to lunch, crowds acclaim<lb/>
him wherever he goes, his photograph is seen in all<lb/>
shops and public places. He is visible everywhere in<lb/>
busts, medals, postcards, on embroidered sofa cushions,<lb/>
and on packages of chocolate. He talks over the<lb/>
radio, he writes prefaces for patriotic books, he opens<lb/>
fairs, goes to football matches, skiing competitions,<lb/>
and first nights at the theaters. One might almost<lb/>
imagine that the Swiss democracy is indulging in the<lb/>

Constitution. That he will automatically give up his<lb/>
powers as soon as his mission is over (that is to say,<lb/>
at the demobilization) is proof that the fundamental<lb/>
tradition of European democracy still lives: this is to<lb/>
name a leader when certain definite needs arise but<lb/>
to name him freely and only for a strictly limited<lb/>
time. The Swiss General is not a Hitler but a Cin-<lb/>
cinnatus. Is not the fact that the Swiss democracy can<lb/>
afford to give such power to one man in times of<lb/>
crisis and can do so without risk to its national institutions<lb/>
the best possible sign of a thoroughly wholesome<lb/>
civic life ?<lb/>
<space/>The possession of arms by the individual is linked<lb/>
with the tradition of local defense and the latter is in<lb/>
turn the product of the conformation of Swiss territory.<lb/>
Each canton in the course of its history has had<lb/>
its own battles, fought alone, to win its independence.<lb/>
Each, therefore, has learned to develop its own<lb/>
particular system of defense according to its topography<lb/>
and resources. Flat countries require large<lb/>
armies, rapid movements, and a dynamic strategy. A<lb/>
country all in small compartments, like Switzerland,<lb/>
does not lend itself to this sort of warfare. Small<lb/>
bodies of men raised on the spot suffice to defend<lb/>
the deep valleys and to bar the passage of narrow<lb/>
gorges and high defiles. It is a question of a firm morale<lb/>
and skillful tactics. If the enemy is too powerful,<lb/>
reinforcements are asked of the neighbors with<lb/>

whom all has long been prearranged. Thus we find<lb/>
at the basis of the military organization the same factors<lb/>
which determine the political structure of the<lb/>
country ; that is, local autonomy and mutual aid. No<lb/>
more of great strategy than of great political policy<lb/>
but a tenacious and skillful use of every least advantage<lb/>
which the terrain and the arms at hand allow.<lb/>
<space/>Most of the cantons correspond grosso modo to the<lb/>
natural divisions of the soil. The cantonal organization<lb/>
of the Army down to the scale of the regiment<lb/>
thus corresponds practically with the military needs,<lb/>
although it originated in far-off historic causes. It is<lb/>
the government of the cantons which recruits the<lb/>
men and names the officers up to the rank of Captain.<lb/>
Thus in a Swiss regiment you will find as a rule men<lb/>
coming from the same part of the country, speaking<lb/>
the same dialect and for the most part knowing each<lb/>
other. As to the larger units, brigades and divisions,<lb/>
they group regiments from neighboring cantons in<lb/>
such a way that each corresponds to what might be<lb/>
called in military terms “territorial compartments.”<lb/>
The officers of higher rank are appointed by the<lb/>
Federal Council. They must know at least two languages,<lb/>
French and German, so that they may command<lb/>
the troops of the various cantons which are<lb/>
grouped under their orders.<lb/>
<space/>In this way, the scheme of military organization is<lb/>
like the political one, and both correspond approximately<lb/>
to the natural divisions of Switzerland. Switz<lb/>

erland has never created a centralized Army according<lb/>
to a theoretical plan. On the contrary, all is<lb/>
founded on local units which have been co-ordinated<lb/>
ever more closely during the centuries. Today unity<lb/>
of command is complete, but the cantonal divisions<lb/>
are used and respected. Each regiment keeps its particular<lb/>
character and customs. The Bernese are strict<lb/>

longer, etc. Each has its songs, its fanfares, its jokes,<lb/>
and its own appearance.<lb/>
<space/>As to the battle order of the Swiss Army, it also<lb/>
has certain peculiarities which are very interesting<lb/>
today. The Army is composed of nine regular divisions,<lb/>
organized into four Army corps. These divisions<lb/>
form the mass which can be maneuvered, the<lb/>
mobile part of the Army. The rest of the forces—almost<lb/>
a half—consists first of garrisons which are established<lb/>
in the forts that defend the principal passages<lb/>
of the Alps, those of the Gothard, of St. Maurice en<lb/>
Valais, of the Sargans ; second, of the mountain brigades,<lb/>
specialists in skiing and alpinism in the Valais<lb/>
and the Grisons ; and lastly of a certain number of independent<lb/>
brigades, the defenders of the frontiers,<lb/>
which are the most typically Swiss units of the Army<lb/>
because of their recruiting and function.<lb/>

to say, the men who compose them are chosen from<lb/>
the cities, villages and farms nearest to the positions<lb/>
which have been prepared on the frontier. They<lb/>
know these positions well for they have themselves arranged<lb/>
them, hollowed them out, cemented them,<lb/>
and fortified them with their own hands. They know<lb/>
how to reach them in one to three hours of march<lb/>
from their own homes. At the first alarm these troops<lb/>
are warned directly by radio, telephone, or telegram,<lb/>
or by the ringing of the tocsin. All that they have to<lb/>
do is to put on their uniforms, take up their rifles,<lb/>
and go to their posts of combat by the very paths<lb/>
which they are in the habit of using. They will find<lb/>
machine guns or anti-tank cannon ready on the spot.<lb/>
Stores of ammunition and food have been hidden in<lb/>
the rocks where they are protected from bombardment.<lb/>
All is ready. In 1939, the placing of these covering<lb/>
troops which preceded the general mobilization<lb/>
by five days was carried out in a few hours upon the<lb/>
whole circumference of the Swiss frontiers.<lb/>
<space/>All this had been prepared over a period of ten<lb/>
years by the Swiss General Staff, which had foreseen<lb/>
exactly what a Blitzkrieg would be. This is the only<lb/>
effective answer to the new form of attack, which is<lb/>
upset by such an almost instantaneous mobilization.<lb/>
Why is it, then, that it has been used only in Switzerland<lb/>
and that so many other countries, such as<lb/>
Poland and Jugoslavia, have allowed themselves to<lb/>
be surprised and disorganized in the first hours of<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
the attack ? The answer is obvious. Switzerland was<lb/>
able to prepare its defense against the Blitzkrieg because<lb/>
it was the only country where the men were already<lb/>
equipped and armed in peacetime. Thus once<lb/>
again it is to its own democratic tradition that the<lb/>
Confederation owes the fact that it is able to meet<lb/>
modern methods of warfare.<lb/>
<space/>The moral advantage of this organization is almost<lb/>
as important as its technical ones. Every Swiss soldier<lb/>
has before his eyes his reasons for living and for dying.<lb/>
These frontier guards take up their fighting positions<lb/>
within a few miles of their own homes. They<lb/>
know exactly what they are defending ; they see it at<lb/>
the foot of that mountain on which they have dug<lb/>
their fortifications, in that valley which they can contemplate<lb/>
during the long watches of the night. There<lb/>
is no need to make speeches to them, to explain the<lb/>
reasons of the effort required of them. Two gestures<lb/>
are enough, the one to point out the frontier before<lb/>
them, the other to show behind them their own village,<lb/>
their fields or their workshops, and the roads<lb/>
which lead to their daily labor. One of the authors<lb/>
of this book was mobilized in 1939 in a frontier post<lb/>
of the Jura. Every morning when the weather was<lb/>
fine, he could take his field glass and, looking through<lb/>
the loophole of the fort, see a certain orchard by the<lb/>
lake 3,000 feet below, where he could sometimes<lb/>
catch a glimpse of a light summer dress or fancy that<lb/>
he recognized his children—such things count in the<lb/>

warfare of today. This is a revolutionary war and<lb/>
therefore as much moral as physical. Probably in the<lb/>
long run it will be the strongest feelings and the<lb/>
deepest convictions which will win. The secret of the<lb/>
Swiss Army is that it has preserved and encouraged<lb/>
the moral factor by a skillful adaptation of tactics to<lb/>
the physical and the human nature of the country.<lb/>
<space/>It should be added that the local use of frontier<lb/>
guards and in a lesser degree of the regular troops is<lb/>
valuable also against sabotage and spying. A stranger<lb/>
is soon detected where the soldiers know the inhabitants<lb/>
and the dialect of the country. In the spring<lb/>
of 1940, when there was much talk of the danger of<lb/>
German parachutists, a Swiss observer was obliged<lb/>
to jump out of his plane as a result of an accident to<lb/>
the engine. He came down with his parachute into<lb/>
an apple tree in the canton of Thurgovia, an agricultural<lb/>
region near the German frontier. While he was<lb/>
trying to extricate himself from his parachute straps<lb/>
the peasants of the neighborhood, armed with pitch-<lb/>
forks and scythes, surrounded the tree. The officer<lb/>
was wearing a Swiss uniform but there had been<lb/>
stories in the newspapers of the campaign in Holland<lb/>
and the peasants were mistrustful. “Certainly I come<lb/>
from this canton !’’<lb/>
<space/>“Can you prove it ?” The poor fellow had to pass a<lb/>
complete examination in the oaths of the Thur-<lb/>
govian dialect, a tongue in which no one could swear<lb/>
correctly unless he had learned to do so with his<lb/>

mother’s milk. Only then was he allowed to come<lb/>
down from his tree.<lb/>
<space/>The question remains as to whether a small army<lb/>
can ever successfully defend a country against an adversary<lb/>
twenty, not to say fifty, times as well equipped.<lb/>
The examples of Norway, of Holland, of Jugoslavia,<lb/>
and of Greece seem to give a crushingly unanimous<lb/>
answer to this question. Yet these examples have not<lb/>
at all demoralized the Swiss soldiers. The lightning<lb/>
victories of the Axis have only made them repeat: “It<lb/>
would not happen that way with us !” They have certain<lb/>
reasons for thinking this which we will examine.<lb/>
<space/>The first act of the Blitzkrieg is to impede or break<lb/>
up the mobilization of the invaded country. This cannot<lb/>
be done in Switzerland. Of course, the enemy air<lb/>
force could easily disorganize the railway communications<lb/>
which are almost entirely electrified and therefore<lb/>
depend on a few central power plants that are<lb/>
highly vulnerable. Switzerland possesses four hundred<lb/>
pursuit planes which have proved their efficiency.<lb/>
In the spring of 1940, they brought down ten<lb/>
or more big German bombers which thought to<lb/>
travel peacefully over Swiss territory. Nonetheless,<lb/>
the Axis could use forces ten or twenty times superior,<lb/>
and would gain the mastery of the air in a<lb/>
few days, possibly in a few hours, as it has done elsewhere.<lb/>
But this would not be decisive. In the first<lb/>
place, the Swiss Army has been permanently mobilized<lb/>
ever since 1939. In the next place, the dis<lb/>

tances are so small that troops could be moved without<lb/>
using the railroads. Finally, the nature of the<lb/>
terrain is not favorable to the effective use of airplanes<lb/>
in battle.<lb/>
<space/>The second phase of the Blitzkrieg is the piercing<lb/>
and the exploitation in depth of the territory behind<lb/>
the lines. Would this be possible in Switzerland ? To<lb/>
describe or foresee the condition of a war in that<lb/>
country, we must always come back to those two fundamental<lb/>
facts, the breaking up of the territory into<lb/>
compartments and the decentralized structure of the<lb/>
Army. Now recent events seem to indicate that these<lb/>
elements, which might have been considered weaknesses<lb/>
in the past, are the only conditions which lend<lb/>
themselves to an effective resistance to mobilized attack.<lb/>
What, in fact, have been the lessons of the present<lb/>
war ? First, we have seen the total failure of the<lb/>
line system of defense. Neither the Mannerheim Line<lb/>
in Finland nor the Maginot Line in France nor the<lb/>
Metaxas Line in Thrace was able to resist for more<lb/>
than a few days, sometimes a few hours, the penetration,<lb/>
prepared by an intense Stuka bombardment, of<lb/>
the armored divisions.<lb/>
<space/>Once the line was pierced, nothing was left in the<lb/>
hinterland but a great empty space, a few policemen,<lb/>
and an amorphous mass of fugitives encumbering the<lb/>
roads. Nothing was left to prevent the destruction of<lb/>
the lines of communication, the seizure of cities and<lb/>
arsenals by a few tanks. This system of linear defense<lb/>

corresponds to the structure of highly centralized nations<lb/>
such as France, in particular, which has a<lb/>
Capital and customs barriers, but nothing between<lb/>
these two, no living regional centers at all.<lb/>
<space/>In Switzerland, on the contrary, there are as many<lb/>
centers of resistance as there are cantons or villages,<lb/>
as many bases of defense solidly organized as there<lb/>
are defiles and mountains. Since the month of May,<lb/>
1940, it may be said that every Swiss village, even in<lb/>
the heart of the country, has been transformed into a<lb/>
sort of autonomous fort or bastion. Its entrances and<lb/>
exits are closed by enormous barricades several yards<lb/>
deep made of tree trunks and blocks of stone, and the<lb/>
walls of certain houses have been re-enforced so as to<lb/>
transform them into miniature fortresses. You open<lb/>
the door of some barn and find yourself face to face<lb/>
with an anti-tank cannon protected by a little cement<lb/>
wall. A rapid advance of motorized divisions could<lb/>
only be made by avoiding the villages and passing<lb/>
through forest roads or over the meadows. But the<lb/>
roads are carefully mined in every direction throughout<lb/>
the country. The forests, particularly those along<lb/>
the Rhine, are the best obstacle there is to the advance<lb/>
of tanks and the best protection against airplane<lb/>
bombardment. Where there are no forests,<lb/>
other natural obstacles exist every four or five miles:<lb/>
deep and rapid streams, valleys and gorges protected<lb/>
by cannon hidden in the rocky walls. In each “compartment”<lb/>
of the territory the enemy would have to<lb/>

stop and develop a formal attack. There would be<lb/>
no question of pushing rapidly along, as in the plains<lb/>
of Flanders or Poland. Even dive-bombing would be<lb/>
almost impossible in many cases because the valleys<lb/>
are so narrow.<lb/>
<space/>“Our terrain is our best ally,” General Guisan proclaimed<lb/>
in one of his bulletins to the Army shortly<lb/>
after the defeat of France. It is the great merit of<lb/>
Switzerland to have been able, thanks to its Federal<lb/>
structure, to make the utmost use of this natural<lb/>
ally. The great wisdom of the Swiss General Staff is<lb/>
to have foreseen as early as 1930 that the next war<lb/>
would not be one of “fronts,” but would be fought<lb/>
everywhere at once, and that a defense must be prepared<lb/>
in depth, relying on nests of local resistance<lb/>
scattered over the territory and carefully equipped<lb/>
long beforehand with men and weapons. The Swiss<lb/>
thus returned to their old traditional way of making<lb/>
war.<lb/>
<space/>It is very striking to find that from the beginnings<lb/>
of the Confederacy these scattered defense tactics<lb/>
were the secret of the Swiss victories over invading<lb/>
forces twenty times as numerous as their own. An interesting<lb/>
example is the battle of Morgarten, which<lb/>
took place in 1315.<lb/>
<space/>In order to crush the cantons the Habsburgs had<lb/>
gathered together an army of 12,000 knights from all<lb/>
the neighboring countries—for the feudal lords could<lb/>
not tolerate in the midst of the Empire a little group<lb/>

of free men who claimed to be sovereign. The Swiss<lb/>
carefully examined the spot where they could fight<lb/>
with some hope of success. They built towers and<lb/>
mighty walls of stone across the passages which led<lb/>
to their territory, leaving only one road open. It was<lb/>
there that the Austrian column of mounted and heavily<lb/>
armed knights at last entered, after trying the<lb/>
other passes and finding them closed. The Swiss were<lb/>
but six hundred. Hidden behind the crests of the<lb/>
hills of Morgarten, above the little lake of Aegeri,<lb/>
they waited the passage of the knights. When these<lb/>
filed between the steep slopes and the shore, the<lb/>
mountaineers suddenly leaped out and rolled down<lb/>
great stones which blocked the way. The whole column<lb/>
was paralyzed. The rear guard was simultaneously<lb/>
attacked and all at once the main body of the<lb/>
Swiss rushed down the mountain, yelling fiercely.<lb/>
They had put nails in their shoes to keep from slipping<lb/>
on the dry grass and had fitted curved steel hooks<lb/>
on the ends of their long pikes. Standing solidly fixed<lb/>
in the soil, they were able with these hooks to harpoon<lb/>
and unhorse the knights, and they made a<lb/>
mighty carnage among them. The battle was over in<lb/>
a half hour if the chroniclers of the time are to be<lb/>
credited. It was an almost exact prefiguration of the<lb/>
battles in the course of which six centuries later the<lb/>
Finns exterminated whole brigades of Russian tanks.<lb/>
The Finnish tactics were also to attack the first and<lb/>
last tanks, and while the line was thus immobilized<lb/>

to fall on their flank and destroy them with anything<lb/>
at hand—sticks thrust into the caterpillar tread, bottles<lb/>
full of gasoline used as grenades. With the Swiss<lb/>
as with the Finns the absolute determination to defend<lb/>
themselves to the death coupled with a favorable<lb/>
terrain and an inventive spirit compensated to some<lb/>
extent for the great disproportion in numbers and<lb/>
equipment.<lb/>
<space/>It is this resolution to defend themselves that must<lb/>
again be underlined in the case of the Swiss today.<lb/>
The two first years of German victory have only reinforced<lb/>
it. The contacts between the men and the<lb/>
soil, between the Army and the people, between the<lb/>
present and historical tradition have grown closer<lb/>
during this long mobilization. Never have the Swiss<lb/>

the powers would necessarily deliver Switzerland to<lb/>

been created in which were included old men and<lb/>

have been prepared there would put them out of<lb/>
commission for years. Many men have sworn solemnly<lb/>
to blow them up even at the cost of their lives<lb/>
on the first sign of invasion. The Axis knows this.<lb/>
<space/>The Axis knows, too, what the Swiss plan of defense<lb/>
is. To a gathering of all the higher officers in<lb/>
charge of the defense which was held in July, 1940,<lb/>
on the meadow of the Riitli, General Guisan explained<lb/>
this plan. The Gothard range was declared<lb/>
to be the national retreat, the central bastion of defense.<lb/>

ready, some to slow down the penetration of the<lb/>
frontiers, others, more numerous, to fall back into<lb/>
the valleys radiating from the Gothard. Half the territory<lb/>
would be sacrificed, but they would be inexpugnable<lb/>
and could hold out not in hope of a final<lb/>
victory but to save the honor of the country, the ideal<lb/>
of liberty and of federalism, and in order to be faithful<lb/>
to the mission and duty of Switzerland.<lb/>
<space/>This famous “report from the Riitli” electrified<lb/>
the Army and the population. Nothing else was<lb/>
talked of anywhere. Some extracts from a speech<lb/>
made by Colonel Fry on April 20, 1941, before a large<lb/>
civilian audience at Berne, will give an idea of the<lb/>
state of mind of the Swiss today.<lb/>
<space/>“The real Confederate is he who never asks with<lb/>
regard to the defense of the land, whether it pays.<lb/>
The true Confederate is hard and obstinate. To those<lb/>
who ask him, ‘Why these sacrifices if they are not to<lb/>
benefit us in the end ?’ he answers, ‘You miscalculate.<lb/>
Neither famine nor war nor deportation will be<lb/>
avoided if we yield without fighting. Liberty is only<lb/>
possible if all are free. Individual liberty cannot survive<lb/>
in a State which fails to defend its independence.<lb/>
But beyond all calculation of profit and loss there<lb/>
are moral values. There is the spirit. There is the<lb/>
federal idea which we must hand on as heritage to<lb/>
our descendants. That is why we will trust in God<lb/>
and not in a man who pretends to be adored as a<lb/>

them. Accumulations of food and ammunition,<lb/>
enough for at least a year, are stored in the rocks and<lb/>
a powerful radio post speaks every morning to the<lb/>

<space/> ROLE<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
1HE Swiss long took their neutrality as a matter<lb/>
of course, or rather considered it as a sort of divine-<lb/>
right privilege. They have been forced by recent<lb/>
events to consider anew the duties and obligations,<lb/>
often very heavy, which are the counterpart of this<lb/>
privilege.<lb/>
<space/>As a matter of fact neutrality is in itself unnatural,<lb/>
for the normal instinct of man is to take sides. It<lb/>
must, therefore, be justified by enduring reasons, and<lb/>
not by mere opportunism.<lb/>
<space/>Certain so-called realists declare that Switzerland is<lb/>
neutral only from self-interest and because of material<lb/>
and utilitarian necessities ; because it is so small<lb/>
a country ; because its geographical location would<lb/>
expose it to so many dangers in case of war ; because<lb/>
its racial diversity would bring about the dislocation<lb/>
of the Confederation if it should take part in any<lb/>
conflict between its neighbors. To this it can be<lb/>
answered that Denmark, Holland, and Greece, which<lb/>
are even smaller than Switzerland, were not neutral,<lb/>
at all events in theory. Today Switzerland is encircled<lb/>

by the Axis, so that the traditional arguments about<lb/>
a strategical or racial equilibrium between two<lb/>
groups of powers are no longer valid. Switzerland’s<lb/>
purely material interest would lead it to accept the<lb/>
“new order” in Europe. Why does it resist so far as<lb/>
it can ?<lb/>
<space/>There can be but one answer. It is because of its<lb/>
European mission and the treaties which have consecrated<lb/>
this mission in the course of the centuries. Imposed<lb/>
by the defeat of Marignano, formulated by the<lb/>
Treaties of Westphalia in 1648, Swiss neutrality was<lb/>
generally accepted by European opinion in the eighteenth<lb/>
century. Bonaparte, after violating it himself,<lb/>
undertook to “protect” it by the Act of Mediation<lb/>
of 1803. We know well today what that word “protect”<lb/>
means when it is used by a despot. Yet it was,<lb/>
after all, an homage rendered to a fact which had become<lb/>
traditional. From 1815 on Swiss neutrality was<lb/>
an essential portion of the European equilibrium and<lb/>
the pivot of the entire policy of the Confederation.<lb/>
<space/>However, when the League of Nations was organized<lb/>
on the principle of collective security, a conflict<lb/>
arose between the tradition of permanent neutrality<lb/>
and the new obligation to share in the military sanctions<lb/>
decreed by the League against an aggressor<lb/>
State. After long negotiations Switzerland at last obtained<lb/>
by the Declaration of London (February, 1920) <lb/>
the right to enter the League without participating<lb/>
in any military sanctions against any State or allow<lb/>

ing the passage of foreign troops over its territory. It<lb/>
was only on this condition that the Swiss people approved<lb/>
by a federal referendum of March 16, 1920,<lb/>
the entry of the Confederation into the League.<lb/>
<space/>That Swiss neutrality is a unique case in Europe<lb/>
and even in the world is implicitly admitted by these<lb/>
exceptional measures, ■which express the facts of a<lb/>
peculiar geographical situation and an historic mission<lb/>
that constitute the policy of this paradoxical<lb/>
State.<lb/>
<space/>But neutrality is a function of the Swiss State and<lb/>
it cannot be interpreted as an individual obligation,<lb/>
to be imposed on each citizen.<lb/>
A Swiss writer, Albert Bonnard, has said: “Swiss<lb/>
neutrality is a conception which applies to the State,<lb/>
not to the individual.” Another author of authority,<lb/>
Philippe Godet, wrote: “There is no such thing for<lb/>
honest men as moral neutrality. Moral neutrality is<lb/>
only possible to those who have no morality. Our human<lb/>
duty can never be to say to our conscience when<lb/>
it grows indignant: ‘Be still, I will not listen ; you<lb/>
will compromise me.’ A people which is reduced to<lb/>
such servility would pay too dear for the happiness of<lb/>
neutrality.”<lb/>
<space/>It must be admitted, however, that permanent neutrality,<lb/>
while it is without doubt a material privilege,<lb/>
brings with it certain moral dangers. It has bred<lb/>
in the Swiss an age-long habit of considering the<lb/>
struggles of their neighbors with a sort of self-right<lb/>

eousness which is sometimes very irritating. It has developed<lb/>
a politically pharisaical attitude of which the<lb/>
Swiss Press has given far too many examples in the<lb/>
last twenty-five years. It is easy to believe oneself impartial<lb/>
and to give advice when one is safely sheltered<lb/>
from blows ! This moralizing attitude can only<lb/>
be overcome by a keen sense of the obligations which<lb/>
the privileges impose. “Noblesse oblige” they said in<lb/>
the days of the old regime, and Switzerland should<lb/>
often repeat to itself “neutrality obliges.” This is<lb/>
what Carl Spitteler expressed so admirably in a<lb/>
speech that he made in Zurich in 1914, which has<lb/>
become famous. Spitteler had just won the Nobel<lb/>
prize. He did not hesitate to speak out, although he<lb/>
knew that it must lose him his wide German public:<lb/>
<space/>“By our modesty we pay to wounded Europe the<lb/>
tribute which it is right to pay to suffering: respect.<lb/>
By our modesty we seek to be forgiven ! Forgiven for<lb/>
what ? . . . Those who have never been at a sick<lb/>
bed will not understand me. A man of heart feels the<lb/>
need of forgiveness for enjoying his health while<lb/>
others suffer. Let us above all avoid a patronizing<lb/>
tone—the appearance of preaching. . . .<lb/>
<space/>“A special favor allows us to assist as witnesses at<lb/>
the fearful tragedy which is going on in Europe. In<lb/>

<space/>“Then we will be taking the really neutral stand/<lb/>
the Swiss stand.”<lb/>
<space/>Above all Swiss neutrality must be positive. It<lb/>
must not be a timid and self-satisfied way of taking<lb/>
shelter, but, on the contrary, an opportunity for creating<lb/>
what the nations at war cannot create. In what<lb/>
way has Swiss neutrality been, according to the formula<lb/>
proposed by the Federal Council, “an active<lb/>
neutrality” ?<lb/>
<space/>It may be answered that the country as it exists<lb/>
today is, as it were, a first creation of neutrality—a<lb/>
“Europe reconciled with itself,” as we have said. It<lb/>
offers a model of what the continent will perhaps be<lb/>
able to achieve only in centuries to come. Moreover<lb/>
it preserves for us certain of the fundamental values<lb/>
of neighboring civilizations, even when these civilizations<lb/>
have lost or have come for a time to despise<lb/>
their own proper genius. This applies particularly to<lb/>
German Switzerland. Even in the period after the<lb/>
Thirty Years’ War travelers who came to it after visiting<lb/>
devastated Germany exclaimed that here was the<lb/>
refuge of the true Germanic life. The same thing can<lb/>
be said of it today. The deep hostility of the German<lb/>
Swiss to Nazism does not prevent them from feeling<lb/>
profoundly German in spirit and in culture—much<lb/>
more German than the Nazis, in particular. All that<lb/>

was likable in German culture, all the spicy good-<lb/>
humor of popular life in Swabia or on the Rhine, can<lb/>
be found today only in Zurich, in Basel, in Berne, or<lb/>
in the country about these cities. As a French Swiss<lb/>
author recently said, “German Switzerland, close at<lb/>
hand, gives us in the midst of war a providential opportunity<lb/>
of loving German culture in its living and<lb/>
human aspects. Yes—to love that civilization with perfect<lb/>
neutrality, with no political afterthought. It is<lb/>
our federal privilege to be able to enjoy in a narrow<lb/>
space the manifold wealth of a torn and shattered<lb/>
Europe.”<lb/>
<space/>As for French Switzerland it is an island of French<lb/>
Protestant culture, unique in the world. There are<lb/>
today four publishing houses which have established<lb/>
themselves in ten different cities of French Switzerland<lb/>
for the purpose of bringing out the works of<lb/>
French writers which can no longer appear in their<lb/>
own country.<lb/>
<space/>The second creative aspect of Swiss neutrality is<lb/>
symbolized by the Red Cross. Switzerland is neutral,<lb/>
as we have shown, because it has a super-national<lb/>
mission to accomplish. Neutrality has enabled it to<lb/>
federate various races within its borders, in spite<lb/>
of their conflicts elsewhere. Its neutrality has also<lb/>
obliged it to become the permanent guardian of international<lb/>
organizations, and the protector of all future<lb/>
federations or attempts at federation.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>About ninety international institutions have<lb/>
chosen one or another of the Swiss cities as their<lb/>
home. Such organizations as the Universal Postal<lb/>
Union, the Latin Monetary Union and the International<lb/>
Office of Industrial and Intellectual Property,<lb/>
settled in Switzerland before the war of 1914. After<lb/>
the peace of 1919 came the League of Nations, the<lb/>
International Labor Bureau, the Bank for International<lb/>
Settlements, the Oecumenical Council of<lb/>
Christian Churches. These few examples indicate the<lb/>
varied character of the organizations, European or<lb/>
world-wide, economic, religious, political, philanthropic,<lb/>
cultural or racial, which have benefited by<lb/>
Swiss neutrality. The papacy alone is lacking in the<lb/>
list of international institutions—but it is not entirely<lb/>
absent. Since the Vatican could not be transferred to<lb/>
Switzerland, the Swiss as early as the Middle Ages<lb/>
went to Rome ! The Papal Guard is an ancient and<lb/>
picturesque but symbolic illustration of the international<lb/>
role of the Confederation. Raphael himself<lb/>
designed the dress and the helmet of these guards,<lb/>
and they are still recruited in the Catholic cantons<lb/>
and commanded by a Swiss Colonel.<lb/>

<space/>It was on the battlefield of Solferino on June 29,<lb/>
1859, that the first vision of the Red Cross was born<lb/>
in the imagination of Henry Dunant. Dunant was a<lb/>
young businessman of Geneva, with a generous heart<lb/>
and a somewhat chimerical spirit. He was not present<lb/>
at Solferino as a soldier, not even as a newspaperman,<lb/>
but as a “mere tourist,” as he said. As a matter of fact<lb/>
he was trying to meet Napoleon III in order to give<lb/>
him a memoir as to the Young Men’s Christian Associations,<lb/>
in which he took an interest. He was an<lb/>
immediate witness of the battle, in which 300,000<lb/>
Frenchmen and Austrians took part, and which was<lb/>
one of the bloodiest conflicts of modern times. Thousands<lb/>
of dead, and tens of thousands of wounded, a<lb/>
day of fiery heat, no organized help for the injured,<lb/>
who were piled hit-or-miss into the churches of the<lb/>
neighboring villages. Thirst tortured them. Flies infected<lb/>
their wounds. The dressings were unpacked in<lb/>
the dust, and put on dirty straw. There was an extreme<lb/>
dearth of surgeons to operate and of orderlies<lb/>
to dress the wounds, which soon became gangrenous.<lb/>
Dunant made super-human efforts to help these poor<lb/>
wretches. He kept, however, a horrible and unforgettable<lb/>
impression of the fearful state to which the lack<lb/>
of care brought the wounded, above all those who<lb/>
fell into enemy hands.<lb/>

book, modestly entitled Recollections of Solferino.<lb/>
The brochure ended with an impassioned appeal “to<lb/>
men of all countries and races who can be moved by<lb/>
the sufferings of their fellowmen.” He proposed that<lb/>
a Society should be created to help wounded soldiers,<lb/>
one which would be recognized by all States and protected<lb/>
by international conventions, so that it would<lb/>
be able to intervene on all battlefields in any war, to<lb/>
help the combatants of every nationality. With the<lb/>
help of Genevans, among them General Defour, victor<lb/>
in the war of the Sonderbund, he undertook a<lb/>
long and difficult campaign whose object was to win<lb/>
the recognition of the heads of the various States for<lb/>
his little “International Committee for help to<lb/>
wounded soldiers.”<lb/>
<space/>“International in its action, but founded by five<lb/>
men of Geneva,” it has been said. It was unprecedented<lb/>
daring for that era, but a daring which sprang<lb/>
from the deepest soul, and from the whole humanitarian<lb/>
tradition of Switzerland. In 1863 a Congress<lb/>
which met in Geneva ratified a charter that foresaw<lb/>
the formation of National Societies and of an International<lb/>
Committee which was to be the connecting<lb/>
link. They adopted as their distinguishing badge the<lb/>
white arm-band with a red cross on it. These were -<lb/>

should participate.<lb/>
<space/>The International Committee of the Red Cross has<lb/>
its headquarters in Geneva, and its personnel is recruited<lb/>
solely among Swiss citizens. Its twenty-five<lb/>
members are renewed by co-option.1 As they are not<lb/>
paid they are necessarily chosen among people of a<lb/>
certain fortune in Geneva, or among those whom<lb/>
diplomatic or professional experience indicates as<lb/>
particularly fitted for their part. Here, then, is an<lb/>
institution which is entirely local in its origins and<lb/>
its personnel, but which, thanks to the permanent<lb/>
neutrality of Switzerland, is entrusted with an eminently<lb/>
international mission. We repeat: it is because<lb/>
all its members are Swiss, and so neutral by definition,<lb/>
that the Committee can act simultaneously on<lb/>
all belligerent governments. It offers them the best<lb/>
guarantee of independence and disinterestedness, and<lb/>
can inspire confidence even in the worst excitement<lb/>
of the struggle. In the present war the Committee of<lb/>
the Red Cross is the only remaining international organization<lb/>
which is actually functioning effectively.<lb/>
It is a noteworthy fact that it has won the respect of<lb/>
Hitler himself. He is very little inclined, as we know,<lb/>

wartime is to create a central agency for collecting<lb/>
information in regard to prisoners and to arrange for<lb/>
communication between them and their families.<lb/>
During the war of 1914-1918 and in the first years of<lb/>
this war there have been several million prisoners in<lb/>
the two camps. This gives an idea of the scope of the<lb/>
work of the Red Cross.<lb/>
<space/>That the Central Agency for Prisoners of War was<lb/>
ready to function in the first days of this war was due<lb/>
to the benevolent personal initiative of a few members<lb/>
of the International Red Cross Committee. Some<lb/>
months before war broke out they had prepared the<lb/>
text of a letter to be sent to each government offering<lb/>
the services of an organization which was foreseen in<lb/>
its minutest details. On September 2, as soon as hostilities<lb/>
were declared, the letter was sent. On September<lb/>
14, as soon as the answers were received, the<lb/>
Agency was opened and went to work. The whole<lb/>
world ought to know how it functions.<lb/>
<space/>We visited its offices in August, 1940. Its headquarters,<lb/>
which have been set up in one of Geneva’s public<lb/>
buildings, impress one first by the extreme simplicity<lb/>
of their arrangements and furnishings. A large<lb/>
central hall surrounded by a circular gallery is occupied<lb/>
by a dozen rows of tables, made of boards set up<lb/>
on trestles. At each row some thirty persons are working.<lb/>

of smaller offices. The Directors have their work<lb/>

signs remind the personnel of the Secretariat and<lb/>
their “volunteer helpers” to keep an absolute silence<lb/>
in regard to all letters or information which pass<lb/>
through their hands. The reason is clear. Here and<lb/>
here alone the number of prisoners, of dead and of<lb/>
wounded on both sides is known exactly. The revelation<lb/>
of these figures to one or other of the belligerents<lb/>
would immediately destroy the trust which both sides<lb/>
put in the agency.<lb/>
<space/>The “voluntary collaborators” are here, and there<lb/>
are more than three thousand of them, whereas there<lb/>
are only about three hundred paid employees. It is<lb/>
thanks to the generous devotion of these three thousand<lb/>

considerable, and its funds come chiefly from private<lb/>

and the prisoner, and establish communication<lb/>
between them.<lb/>
<space/>Here, in one of the wings, is a little square office<lb/>
where five stenographers are at work under the direction<lb/>
of a large and active young man. He tells us with<lb/>
a certain pride that he alone in the whole Agency<lb/>
has the duty of announcing to relatives the deaths<lb/>
which have occurred either on the battlefield or in<lb/>
the prison camps. He seems to have a keen sense of<lb/>
his responsibility, and, seeing with what scrupulous<lb/>
care he verifies every detail of his tragic information,<lb/>
we must admit that he is worthy of this heavy duty.<lb/>
<space/>We leave the office of the announcer of death to<lb/>
visit a member of the Executive Committee. He<lb/>
shows us on a blackboard some figures which sum up<lb/>
the activities of the Agency. From September 2,'1939,<lb/>
to August 15, 1940, 950,000 letters had been received,<lb/>
read and classified. 840,000 letters had been sent ;<lb/>
5,000 special inquiries had been made as to soldiers,<lb/>
and 26,000 as to civilians ; 600,000 messages from<lb/>
civilians on special postcards had been transmitted<lb/>
in various countries and continents ; 63 dockets had<lb/>
been prepared containing more than 8,000,000 cards.<lb/>
The daily mail sometimes brings as many as 60,000<lb/>
letters, and they must not be allowed to accumulate,<lb/>
for the next day may bring an even larger number,<lb/>
according to the unpredictable developments of a war<lb/>
which is constantly extending to other nations. Since<lb/>

that time, all these figures have of course doubled<lb/>
and trebled.<lb/>
<space/>These numbers are not mere numbers. They represent<lb/>
millions of human agonies. Each of these<lb/>
questions is a cry: Is he alive ? Where is he ? Is he<lb/>
wounded ? Each of these answers brings an immense<lb/>
relief for some family—or else a cruel anguish. Here<lb/>
in the Agency of Prisoners war no longer seems to be<lb/>
a great movement of political forces, or of military<lb/>
powers, nor an opportunity for heroic or passionate<lb/>
acts of prowess. It is the immeasurable tragedy of<lb/>
hundreds of thousands of homes—threatened, mutilated<lb/>
or destroyed. Nothing is more pathetic than<lb/>
these reference cards, on which the red line, drawn<lb/>
carefully by a “voluntary collaborator,” registers the<lb/>
fate of a family. Nothing is more moving than these<lb/>
offices, where, to the accompaniment of the noise of<lb/>
a hundred typewriters, two long, groping, and desperate<lb/>
searches—separated by thousands of miles—his<lb/>
from his prison camp ; theirs from their home—come<lb/>
together at last to give birth to a message.<lb/>
<space/>The present war has killed fewer men than the last.<lb/>
These 8,000,000 messages, received and sent on by<lb/>
the Agency for Prisoners, are most of them messages<lb/>
of life. They represent millions of homes which find<lb/>
relief from the worst agony. Does not such an accomplishment<lb/>
alone justify the existence of a small neutral<lb/>
country ?<lb/>

XI. SWITZERLAND DURING THE WAR<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
IN the spring of 1939 the National Exhibition<lb/>
opened at Zurich. These Exhibitions take place every<lb/>
twenty-five years, and the last one had been interrupted<lb/>
by the war of 1914. Those who were superstitious<lb/>
saw an evil omen in the return of the Exhibition,<lb/>
but what the people in general found was an<lb/>
admirable proof of the benefits of federal peace and<lb/>
of the cohesion, firmer than ever, of the three groups<lb/>
which it harmonizes. The many strangers who visited<lb/>
Zurich came away enthusiastic and even amazed ;<lb/>
everything was so perfect, so well-finished in those<lb/>
constructions, where the most advanced tendencies of<lb/>
modern art were wedded to the best traditional elements,<lb/>
where imposing effects were never obtained by<lb/>
the “Kolossal” but by an exact proportion of surfaces<lb/>
and volumes. An artificial river allowed visitors to see<lb/>
the whole Exhibition while sitting quietly in a little<lb/>
boat. This river skirted the avenues lined with trees,<lb/>
crossed the esplanades which opened upon the pale<lb/>
blue lake, and wound about among the pavilions, between<lb/>
gleaming machines from the factories of Win-<lb/>
therthur, before the displays of sumptuous silks, and<lb/>

under the iridescent vaults of the Palace of Aluminum.<lb/>
The history of Switzerland had been illustrated<lb/>
in frescoes along a high-running road which dominated<lb/>
the whole Exhibition and led to a room entirely<lb/>
bare save for a huge reproduction of the Pact<lb/>
of 1291 and the three Crosses ; the Christian Cross,<lb/>
that of the Swiss flag and that of the Red Cross.<lb/>
<space/>On the second of September the water of the river<lb/>
ceased to flow, and the esplanades were empty. In the<lb/>
fields the peasants had handed over their implements<lb/>
to their wives. They had hurried to don their uniforms<lb/>
and gallop off on their horses. The defense of<lb/>
the frontier had been provided for several days earlier<lb/>
by the call to arms of the local troops assigned to that<lb/>
task. In forty-eight hours the entire mobilization was<lb/>
complete, and the first cannon had not yet been fired<lb/>
on the Rhine.<lb/>
<space/>“They say we will fight tonight,” the men told each<lb/>
other, as they marched in column along the country<lb/>
roads under a sweltering sun. Only yesterday they<lb/>
were in the factory or the office, yet they carried<lb/>
without grumbling their ninety pounds of equipment.<lb/>
They reached their posts and waited. As we<lb/>
write this they are waiting still.<lb/>
<space/>The hardest test for a modern Army is this prolonged<lb/>
waiting in arms. That was made plain by the<lb/>
rapid collapse of France after eight months of inaction<lb/>
and card-playing in the shelter of the Maginot<lb/>
Line.<lb/>

</p>
        <p rend="block big"><space/>To the Federal Council and the Swiss General Staff<lb/>
must be given credit for having foreseen this danger<lb/>
from the first. Every resource was methodically used<lb/>
to bolster up the morale both of the troops and of the<lb/>
civilian population, and also to avoid the innumerable<lb/>
causes of discontent, and therefore of defeatism,<lb/>
which come with a prolonged mobilization. Switzerland<lb/>
had understood that the war of today is a<lb/>
formidable conflict of ideologies and of propaganda.<lb/>
Propaganda is the real “secret weapon” of which there<lb/>
has been so much talk, and it is, therefore, only by<lb/>
forging spiritual arms that the courage and will to<lb/>
use material arms can be given to the nation.<lb/>
<space/>The General Staff organized a special service, called<lb/>
Army and Home, which was given two duties ; on the<lb/>
one hand to assure the liaison between the mobilized<lb/>
men and the population, and on the other to keep<lb/>
civic spirit alive among the troops, that is to say to<lb/>
teach them to use their leisure.<lb/>
<space/>To accomplish this latter task the following organization<lb/>
was adopted: a Central Office appointed in<lb/>
each unit of the Army, each division or brigade, a<lb/>
liaison officer who in turn named a responsible officer,<lb/>
lieutenant or non-commissioned officer in each battalion.<lb/>
The Central Office sent to these correspondents<lb/>
lists of civilian or military lecturers, a lending library<lb/>
(in cases of ten or fifty books) , mobile theatrical companies<lb/>
and variety shows, radio and moving-picture<lb/>
equipment and, lastly, brief outlines of talks which<lb/>

the officers were to give to the men each week during<lb/>
an interim of their work. Through this organization<lb/>
the High Command was constantly aware of the state<lb/>
of mind of the Army, and of questions such as these<lb/>
which the soldiers were asking: “Why are we neutral ?”<lb/>
“Are we strong enough ?” “Has Switzerland any<lb/>
real justification for resisting the wave of totalitarianism ?”<lb/>
“Can it hold out economically ?” It was inevitable<lb/>
that men who were separated from their families<lb/>
and their professions, who were tired and who<lb/>
suffered from the bitter winter should sometimes be<lb/>
troubled by doubts. The outlined talks suggested answers<lb/>
to these questions, reminded the men of the<lb/>
lessons of Swiss history, brought them up to date, and<lb/>
gave concrete arguments with which to meet foreign<lb/>
propaganda.<lb/>
<space/>More, much more was done to reinforce the bond<lb/>
between the Army and the civilian population. In a<lb/>
few months an organization was started whose social<lb/>
and economic importance will probably be seen to be<lb/>
much greater after the war than its creators themselves<lb/>
imagined.<lb/>
<space/>This was the Compensation Fund, which works on<lb/>
the following principle: both the workers and the<lb/>
employers contribute to it, the former paying in three<lb/>
per cent of their earnings, the latter three per cent of<lb/>
the total volume of their business transactions. The<lb/>
resulting sum is distributed to the wives of the soldiers<lb/>
as compensation for the salary which their hus<lb/>

bands can no longer earn. This concrete work of<lb/>
social solidarity did more than all the patriotic propaganda<lb/>
to appease discontent. It made the citizens<lb/>
proud of their institutions, and reinforced the morale<lb/>
of the Army as much as a victory could have done.<lb/>
Moreover it suggested possibilities for the future.<lb/>
There is already talk of carrying it on after the war<lb/>
in the form of permanent old age insurance.<lb/>
<space/>It was, therefore, under the best possible conditions,<lb/>
both from the military and the civilian point<lb/>
of view, that Switzerland met the crisis of the spring<lb/>
of 1940, which ended the “phoney war” so abruptly.<lb/>
<space/>In a few days the whole country was transformed<lb/>
into a vast armed camp. Enormous barricades were<lb/>
thrown up everywhere, passersby and automobilists<lb/>
were inspected, a universal hunt for Fifth Columnists<lb/>
was set on foot (hundreds were arrested) and a feverish<lb/>
organization of local guards went on. Everyone<lb/>
expected invasion from one hour to the next. The<lb/>
danger grew as the French forces retreated along the<lb/>
Jura, opening the western frontier to the Germans.<lb/>
What was particularly feared was that the latter<lb/>
would attempt a raid on Lyons through the Swiss<lb/>
plateau. There were many violations of Swiss territory<lb/>
by German planes, and people even talked in<lb/>
cautious phrases of an attempt made to sabotage Swiss<lb/>
aerodromes by the “tourists” who arrived in great<lb/>
numbers at a time on a certain Sunday night. . . .<lb/>
<space/>Tension lessened suddenly with the announcement<lb/>

of the French request for an armistice. The whole<lb/>
situation was altered. Switzerland could no longer<lb/>
count on any ally if it was invaded. It found itself<lb/>
surrounded and cut off. The “finest army in Europe”<lb/>
had collapsed. Could Switzerland hold out ? Was it<lb/>
worth while to continue the crushing effort of national<lb/>
defense ?<lb/>
<space/>A few weeks of heavy uneasiness followed. A portion<lb/>
of the press began to alter its tone, to try to find<lb/>
some “better side” to the totalitarian regimes. The<lb/>
people, ashamed of this change of face, had no way<lb/>
of showing their feelings. They received silently, but<lb/>
with amazed indignation, a message from the President<lb/>
of the Confederation, who spoke of “relief”<lb/>
because the struggle between the neighbors of Switzerland<lb/>
was over. … A so-called “national” movement<lb/>
was beginning to spread propaganda among<lb/>
the workmen, promising them a new socialism, and<lb/>
asking for anti-semitic measures. . . . But the Army<lb/>
was still resolute.<lb/>
<space/>There was urgent need of a speedy and vigorous<lb/>
reaction. But where was the initiative to come from ?<lb/>
Any energetic action on the part of the Government<lb/>
would have been considered by the Axis as a “provocation.”<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>Then it was that a dozen men met secretly at<lb/>
Berne. They were young officers, professors, left-wing<lb/>
syndicalists and right-wing “corporative state” men,<lb/>

writers, business men—all determined to pool their<lb/>
efforts to save the country.<lb/>
<space/>The gravity of the hour brought former adversaries<lb/>
together. Prejudices fell before the extreme peril.<lb/>
Opinion was ready for new solutions. It was important<lb/>
that these solutions should be Swiss and not importations<lb/>
from abroad. It was important to fix clearly<lb/>
what must be kept of the Swiss heritage at all costs,<lb/>
and what could be renewed freely, according to<lb/>
ancient custom.<lb/>
<space/>They soon agreed to define the situation as follows:<lb/>
“First, Switzerland is reduced to its own resources,<lb/>
as it has often been in the course of its history. It will<lb/>
survive this European crisis if it can succeed in surmounting<lb/>
its divisions and in collaborating in its own<lb/>
way in the creation of a new order.<lb/>
<space/>“Second, the collapse of French democracy cannot<lb/>
shake our faith in the federalist democracy, Christian<lb/>
in spirit, on which Switzerland is based.<lb/>
<space/>“Third, the defense of our independence at all costs<lb/>
and the struggle against defeatism are the urgent tasks<lb/>
of the hour. Those who doubt the necessity of the<lb/>
possibility of our resistance are traitors. The unanimous<lb/>
affirmation of our absolute determination to<lb/>
defend ourselves, whatever happens, is our only<lb/>
chance of safety.<lb/>
<space/>“Fourth, there would be no defeatism if every Swiss<lb/>
citizen was fully conscious of the true meaning of<lb/>

236 THE HEART OF EUROPE<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
Switzerland as an ideal and a treasure-house of civil<lb/>
liberties, dearly won.<lb/>
<space/>“Fifth, there would be no defeatism if each Swiss<lb/>
citizen saw a possibility of working actively in the<lb/>
direction of needed reforms in the social, economic<lb/>
and political order. One cannot die for Switzerland<lb/>
unless one has reason to live for it.<lb/>
<space/>“Sixth, it is obvious that the needed reforms cannot<lb/>
be brought about in our country in our Federal State<lb/>
either by the Rights alone or by the Lefts alone. The<lb/>
collaboration of all the living groups in the country<lb/>
is necessary.<lb/>
<space/>“Youth today is turning more and more away from<lb/>
political parties to groups which act outside these.<lb/>
. . . Group spirit must replace party spirit.”<lb/>
<space/>A League was founded soon afterwards. It was<lb/>
given the name of League of the Gothard, for its first<lb/>
manifesto declared that “The Gothard, natural rampart<lb/>
of Switzerland, heart of Europe and frontier of<lb/>
races, is the great symbol in whose name all the Confederates<lb/>
can unite, in spite of their diversities.” This<lb/>
League brought together delegates from almost all<lb/>
existing groups, save the political parties, from the<lb/>
Trades-Unions to the Oxford Group, from the<lb/>
League of the “reliefless” (a group formed for economic<lb/>
struggle) to the Boy Scouts, from the Cooperatives<lb/>
to the Catholic Corporationists.<lb/>
<space/>The first act of the League was to publish a proc<lb/>

        <p rend="block big">
lamation in eighty newspapers which filled an entire<lb/>
page, and which called upon the people and its leaders<lb/>
to resist at any cost, and to make an effort at<lb/>
collaboration between all classes.<lb/>
<space/>Three sets of manifestoes, published a few days<lb/>
apart, which brought together signatures that had<lb/>
never before been seen side by side, a series of articles,<lb/>
and above all the vigorous personal action of the<lb/>
founders of the League in the Army and in the most<lb/>
varied civilian groups—all this struck public opinion<lb/>
and reawakened confidence.<lb/>
<space/>In several cities delegates of the Workmen’s Unions<lb/>
and of the Employer’s Associations met under the<lb/>
auspices of the League and adopted a plan of “professional<lb/>
community” proposed by the left-wing unions.<lb/>
At the same time the political parties, alarmed at this<lb/>
competition, formed “communities of labor” in several<lb/>
cantons. There was a sort of political truce.<lb/>
<space/>When the national holiday came, on August 1, it<lb/>
was evident that the fog of defeatism and panic had<lb/>
lifted. The action of a small group of citizens, fully<lb/>
aware of their responsibility, had been enough to<lb/>
clarify public opinion. Nothing is more characteristic<lb/>
of federal patriotism than this almost instant appearance<lb/>
of a center of resistance and of activity at a time<lb/>
when the authorities were paralyzed. Nothing could<lb/>
be more reassuring as to the vitality of Swiss democracy.<lb/>

present and perceptible to the Swiss, although the<lb/>
cannon on the frontiers were silent. It was obvious<lb/>
first of all by the presence of the interned Allies.<lb/>
Thirty thousand French and Polish soldiers had<lb/>
crossed the Swiss frontiers shortly before the Armistice,<lb/>
escaping from the Germans. They had to be disarmed,<lb/>
fed, lodged. As their stay bid fair to be protracted<lb/>
and it was feared that they might demoralize<lb/>
the villages where they were sheltered, something had<lb/>
to be done to occupy them. They were allowed to<lb/>
work in the fields, and a sort of popular university<lb/>
was organized for them by private means and with<lb/>
the help of the Y.M.C.A., where many were able to<lb/>
continue their studies.<lb/>
<space/>War was evident, too, in more dangerous ways. Several<lb/>
times English airplanes, gone astray, bombarded<lb/>
Lausanne, Geneva, Basel, and Zurich, thinking they<lb/>
were flying over Italian territory. A certain number<lb/>
of people were killed and wounded and a few houses<lb/>
were destroyed. A general blackout was decreed for<lb/>
all Switzerland, which is still in force.<lb/>
<space/>Material restrictions, too, began to weigh heavily<lb/>
on the population. Even before the outbreak of war<lb/>
the prudent Swiss Government had foreseen these<lb/>
difficulties. As early as the spring of 1939, directly<lb/>
after the occupation of Prague, Swiss housewives had<lb/>
each been required individually to lay by stocks sufficient<lb/>
for some months, of various staples such as<lb/>
sugar, macaroni, dried vegetables, rice, and so on. As<lb/>

        <p>

</p>
        <p rend="block big">
soon as the mobilization was decreed the free sale of<lb/>
these staples was forbidden, and a system of food<lb/>
cards was established. This allowed the Confederation<lb/>
to gather large reserves. It was thanks to this foresight<lb/>
that the Swiss were able to get through the next<lb/>
winter without famine. One by one the channels of<lb/>
communication were closed. The fall of France and<lb/>
the disorganization which followed prevented the<lb/>
Swiss from bringing goods up from the Mediterranean<lb/>
through the Rhone Valley. A single railway line<lb/>
still connected Switzerland with France near Geneva.<lb/>
By some inexplicable accident a bridge on this line<lb/>
was blown up on October 3. All that was left was<lb/>
Italy and the port of Genoa. Switzerland had obtained<lb/>
the use of Greek boats, but when Greece in<lb/>
turn was attacked all communication by sea was cut<lb/>
off. It was only in the spring of 1941 that Switzerland<lb/>
was able to buy a few ships for herself ; they can sometimes<lb/>
be seen in the port of New York, flying the<lb/>
Swiss flag. The tragic events of this year have made<lb/>
the classic joke about the Swiss navy into a reality ! 1<lb/>
<space/>What is the economic condition of Switzerland today,<lb/>
placed as it is in the center of the Axis ?<lb/>
<space/>The delay or suppression of the means of international<lb/>
transport and commerce are extremely danger-<lb/>
1 As to the joke about the "Swiss Admiral," it had been a fact for<lb/>
some time. Admiral Eberle, who commanded the whole American<lb/>
fleet in 1923, was Swiss by birth, as was Admiral de Steiger, who<lb/>
commanded the Pacific fleet.<lb/>

ous for a country like Switzerland, which has no raw<lb/>
materials and which is, above all, an exporting concern.<lb/>
The Federal Council, faced with this vital danger,<lb/>
was obliged to adopt a series of “plans” and regulations<lb/>
which were like a sort of war-time “new deal.”<lb/>
<space/>There were stocks of provisions on hand, but only<lb/>
enough for a few months, although a long war had<lb/>
been foreseen. Switzerland was in the position of a<lb/>
besieged city which could still occasionally negotiate.<lb/>
A commercial treaty was concluded with Germany in<lb/>
1940, based on the exchange of a given number of<lb/>
pigs for a number of tons of coal. At the same time<lb/>
Switzerland developed with astonishing rapidity a series<lb/>
of “ersatz” (substitute) industries. From the waste<lb/>
of the city of Zurich a gas has been extracted which<lb/>
replaces automobile gasoline, and a gas developed<lb/>
from wood has been used for the same purpose, as it<lb/>
has been in France. Chemical products (paraldehydes) <lb/>
replace alcohol. But it is in the agricultural field that<lb/>
the greatest effort has been expended. A departmental<lb/>
head of the Bureau of Agriculture, Dr. F. T. Wahlen,<lb/>
has proposed a vast project for increased production,<lb/>
which already in the first few months of its functioning<lb/>
has added 50,000 acres to the surface of Switzerland’s<lb/>
productive land, and doubled the wheat-yielding<lb/>
area.<lb/>
<space/>Wheat has been planted in all the parks and public<lb/>
squares of cities. In this way unemployment has decreased<lb/>
and the whole population in the cities, as well<lb/>

as in the country, feels that it is sharing in the common<lb/>
work of national defense, by enabling Switzerland<lb/>
to feed itself and so be independent of its neighbors.<lb/>
It is hard to believe that the soil of Switzerland<lb/>
could yield more than it already did. To accomplish<lb/>
this an immense effort, a mingling of all private<lb/>
initiatives in a national framework, was required.<lb/>
The spirit in which this urgent task has been undertaken<lb/>
is all that can prevent it from turning into a<lb/>
form of state collectivism.<lb/>
<space/>Two facts stand out in the financial situation of<lb/>
Switzerland. In the first place, three billion Swiss<lb/>
francs have been spent on the mobilization since 1939<lb/>
and three war taxes have been added to those already<lb/>
existing. Since these new fiscal burdens are not<lb/>
enough to meet the expenses of the national defense,<lb/>
the Government wishes to introduce indirect taxes,<lb/>
which until now have been very unpopular in Switzerland.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>The cost of living has increased twenty-five per cent<lb/>
since the beginning of the war and restrictions are<lb/>
growing more numerous and heavier every month.<lb/>
<space/>Milk, bread, potatoes, and cheese can still be<lb/>
bought freely, but clothes, shoes, wool, and silk are<lb/>
strictly rationed, and coal is becoming scarce and<lb/>
dear.<lb/>
<space/>The following table shows the monthly ration allowed<lb/>

Only a country in which there prevails a civic<lb/>
discipline both spontaneous and traditional could<lb/>
hope to meet so difficult a situation without an outbreak<lb/>

foreign propaganda. The Swiss seem to understand<lb/>
what the present alternatives are: collectivist regimentation<lb/>
or voluntary self-discipline. They have<lb/>
chosen the latter.<lb/>
<space/>Politically Swiss opinion has, on the whole, reacted<lb/>
to this state of things with a kind of conscientious<lb/>
moderation, a coolness which is almost Anglo-Saxon,<lb/>
but which has in fact been imposed upon it by circumstances.<lb/>

between the two halves of the nation. This time there<lb/>
is no gulf. As far as one can judge from letters and<lb/>
conversations, and read through the very prudence of<lb/>
the newspapers, Swiss opinion is universally anti-<lb/>
Nazi. The effort to reconstruct the “frontist” movement<lb/>
of 1934 to 1935, which was pro-Nazi, was killed<lb/>

XII. THE FEDERAL WAY OF LIFE<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
SWITZERLAND was born under the sign of the<lb/>
Cross. Switzerland is a crusade, motionless in space<lb/>
but marching on in time, coming from a very long<lb/>
past and showing us a path to the future.<lb/>
<space/>At the end of the “highway” which dominated the<lb/>
Exhibition at Zurich in 1939, stood one of the most<lb/>
magnificent symbols of its destiny that any people has<lb/>
ever found: the Three Crosses, that of the Swiss flag,<lb/>
that of the Red Cross which is its daughter, and the<lb/>
Cross of Christ which is their eternal origin.<lb/>
<space/>Woe to the people that has no symbols, or that no<lb/>
longer understands their meaning ! The Swiss have<lb/>
known how to be faithful to their three Crosses, and<lb/>
that is why their nation is still strong.<lb/>
<space/>The Swiss flag was originally that of the canton of<lb/>
Schwytz. The White Cross was the sign of a Christian<lb/>
nation, the red background signified that it was an<lb/>
imperial land. Little by little the name of “Schwytzer”<lb/>
was adopted by all the Confederates, and the flag of<lb/>
the free canton became that of all the Alliance, or<lb/>
“Bund.” Thus the national and patriotic symbol of<lb/>
the Swiss recalls their primitive “imperial” mission<lb/>

in the political and military order. In defending their<lb/>
flag the Swiss soldiers first of all defend concretely<lb/>
their State and their liberties, but they also defend<lb/>
the ideal of the Christian Empire, that is to say, of a<lb/>
confederated Europe ruled by the highest spiritual<lb/>
values.<lb/>
<space/>The flag of the Red Cross is an inversion of the<lb/>
preceding: the white background is the color of<lb/>
peace. It is the sign of the universal mission of the<lb/>
Swiss State in the order of humanity, the sign of an<lb/>
active and creative neutrality.<lb/>
<space/>Finally that Cross, which, after passing through the<lb/>
red field and the white field, towers to its full height<lb/>
in the background, is the symbol of sacrifice, of the<lb/>
love of fellow-man, and of obedience to an eternal<lb/>
will which transcends the selfish desires of men and<lb/>
nations and their historic vicissitudes.<lb/>
<space/>All this seems very “romantic” in the eyes of the<lb/>
“realists” of our day, but perhaps the example of<lb/>
Switzerland, of its solidity and its long survival, may<lb/>
bring them to reflect anew as to the true nature of<lb/>
realism. To be realistic is to take into account reality,<lb/>
but the whole of reality ; to face facts, yes, but all of<lb/>
the facts. Now here is a fact which this entire book<lb/>
has illustrated: Switzerland, made up of paradoxes,<lb/>
was only able to come into being and to endure<lb/>
through the strength of its federal, humanitarian and<lb/>
Christian ideal. On the plane of material interests, of<lb/>
economic selfishness and racial arrogance, it had no<lb/>

sufficient reason for being. In fact the Confederation<lb/>
had at various periods important reasons for breaking<lb/>
up. It exists only by virtue of what modern “realism”<lb/>
considers non-existent. The “realists” who still<lb/>
doubt the practical and concrete force of a common<lb/>
ideal are actually backward minds. They have not<lb/>
known how to draw from present history its lessons.<lb/>
They still belong to the mentality of those who in the<lb/>
past century knew not how to take anything seriously<lb/>
except money and money-making. To appreciate the<lb/>
whole value of that kind of “realism” we need only<lb/>
see to what it has brought the world ; we need only<lb/>
look around us.<lb/>
<space/>But there is another realism—the true one which<lb/>
acknowledges that spiritual and psychological factors,<lb/>
the symbols of communion and the will of man, are<lb/>
more important in history than so-called economic<lb/>
“interests.” This is not a phrase destined to flatter<lb/>
religious or humanitarian sentimentality. We are<lb/>
merely describing a fact. It is because the dictators<lb/>
of our day have recognized this fact—although they<lb/>
have made an atrocious use of it—that they have<lb/>
found it so easy to beat the “realists” who began by<lb/>
making fun of them. Here is an example: Hitler has<lb/>
won enormous military victories without gold or<lb/>
financial credit. The “realists” judged this impossible,<lb/>
naive and romantic. But Hitler has demonstrated<lb/>
by sheer fact that a moral force—even if it is<lb/>
an inferior or a destructive one, such as Nazi fanati<lb/>

cism—can easily overcome nations which are much<lb/>
richer and more populous, but which have no living<lb/>
ideal. It will be objected that it was not a moral<lb/>
force, but tanks and planes that defeated France. Yes,<lb/>
but why did not France, which was much richer than<lb/>
the ruined Reich, secure for itself the necessary planes<lb/>
and tanks ? In a way quite different from that of the<lb/>
dictators, needless to say, Switzerland has demonstrated<lb/>
by its existence that moral forces are more<lb/>
real and more effective than material interests. By<lb/>
virtue of its ideal of solidarity it has bsen able to<lb/>
solve the most difficult economic problem ; that of<lb/>
maintaining a high standard of living in a country<lb/>
without natural resources. By virtue of its ideal of<lb/>
tolerance and co-operation it has been able to surmount<lb/>
the racial rivalries which have been the cause<lb/>
of most modern wars. Lastly, by virtue of its ideal of<lb/>
liberty it has been able to accept the enormous effort<lb/>
(one quite contrary to its material interests) of keeping<lb/>
an army of half a million men mobilized. In these<lb/>
three cases and in twenty more like them, if Switzerland<lb/>
had been “realistic” in the vulgar sense of the<lb/>
word, it would long since have disappeared. If it still<lb/>
exists, it is because the nation has practiced a very<lb/>
different realism—that which gives its real place to the<lb/>
moral ideal.<lb/>
<space/>No nation is strong without a truly living common<lb/>
ideal. This is the first lesson which we draw from the<lb/>
example of Switzerland.<lb/>

</p>
        <p rend="block big"><space/>The second is more particular, and perhaps even<lb/>
more important. It is that an ideal can be truly living<lb/>
and active only in a human community which is not<lb/>
too big. If the Swiss ideal has shown itself to be more<lb/>
effective, in last analysis, than so-called “material interests,”<lb/>
it is because Switzerland is a small country.<lb/>
<space/>Let us contrast the Swiss example with that of<lb/>
totalitarianism. In both cases we have nations which<lb/>
are strong because they are bound together by influences<lb/>
of a moral order, and these create a unity<lb/>
beyond that of material interests with their rivalries.<lb/>
But in the case of the totalitarians we deal with<lb/>
standardized masses whose bond is, at bottom, an<lb/>
ideology that has been taught them, imposed upon<lb/>
them in a few years by a party, introduced by force<lb/>
into their minds by means of exactly the same technique<lb/>
as that used by advertisers on the radio. In<lb/>
Switzerland we find, instead, diversified groups whose<lb/>
bond is an ideal, intimately approved by each man,<lb/>
slowly evolved from a long tradition, cultivated by<lb/>
a patient and liberal education. Among the totalitarians,<lb/>
tyrannical slogans ; in Switzerland an innate<lb/>
civic spirit. There a rigid and uniform framework,<lb/>
imposed from without ; here organic structures,<lb/>
deeply rooted in life.<lb/>
<space/>Most of these differences come from the fact that<lb/>
totalitarianism is the regime of large countries, hence<lb/>
of masses, whereas Switzerland is a small country. In<lb/>

a small country, groups can remain alive. In a living<lb/>
group an ideal can remain practical.<lb/>
<space/>Thus the example of Switzerland raises the urgent<lb/>
question of the normal size of a human community.<lb/>
It is a problem which has been tragically overlooked<lb/>
until now, but present events oblige us to face and<lb/>
solve it in one way or another. It seems to us to be<lb/>
absolutely vital for the future of democracy.<lb/>
<space/>Democracy is considered as the regime of liberty.<lb/>
Theoretically, indeed, freedom of speech, of worship,<lb/>
of opposition, and certain economic freedoms are secured<lb/>
under it by law. But here is the capital question:<lb/>
Can this ideal be realized on any scale ? What,<lb/>
for instance, does freedom of expression mean practically<lb/>
in a very large democracy ? Legally each and<lb/>
every individual has the right to speak and to write.<lb/>
But what is the use of speaking if one is not heard<lb/>
or read ? And how can a single voice carry beyond a<lb/>
small group ? If such a voice is to be heard in a large<lb/>
nation it must make use of the press and the radio.<lb/>
Even if the press and the radio should allow the individual<lb/>
entire freedom of speech—which is improbable<lb/>
for commercial reasons—they are very costly. Not<lb/>
everyone can afford that luxury. The result is that in<lb/>
too large a democracy the average individual has no<lb/>
means of making use of his legal right of freedom of<lb/>
speech. This right is in fact only a fiction for the vast<lb/>
majority of citizens. It is an abstract possibility which<lb/>

        <p>
THE FEDERAL WAY OF LIFE 251<lb/>
</p>
        <p rend="block big">
can come to concrete realization only for a very small<lb/>
minority.<lb/>
<space/>Thus the same right, guaranteed by the same law,<lb/>
is real in a small community, but fictitious in a larger<lb/>
one. Democracy being the regime of individual liberties,<lb/>
it can only be effectively exercised in dimensions<lb/>
where individual activity is effective. That is to say,<lb/>
in the dimensions of a group, not of the masses.<lb/>
<space/>From this point of view we do not hesitate to say<lb/>
that Switzerland is actually the only country where<lb/>
the democratic regime had been concretely operative.<lb/>
Elsewhere it is a latent possibility, a hope, perhaps a<lb/>
beneficent illusion ; in Switzerland it is a daily fact.<lb/>
<space/>By virtue of its geography, its history, and the constant<lb/>
will of its people, Switzerland has remained a<lb/>
small State, founded on the collaboration of divers<lb/>
groups, not on a vast unity of race, language, class or<lb/>
ideology. The regime which is founded on the diversity<lb/>
and harmony of varied groups is called federalism.<lb/>
Federalism is, in our opinion, the only concrete<lb/>
realization of the democratic ideal.<lb/>
<space/>But federalism is much more than a political<lb/>
regime. It is a philosophy—a way of life. Its basic doctrine<lb/>
is that of respect for the diversity of vocations<lb/>
and persons. It is a radical anti-imperialism. Its perpetual<lb/>
ambition is union in diversity. This is the<lb/>
exact opposite of the totalitarian ambition. Wherever<lb/>
unity by standardization is sought, even within a<lb/>
democracy, the very bases of the democratic ideal are<lb/>

destroyed, and the bases of totalitarianism are set up.<lb/>
Federalism starts from the original diversity of things<lb/>
and creatures, and never tends to suppress this diversity,<lb/>
but, on the contrary, seeks to make it fertile. In<lb/>
this respect it is the one doctrine that is genuinely<lb/>
realistic, that is to say, in agreement with the laws of<lb/>
nature. For nature itself is anti-totalitarian. Whatever<lb/>
is organic, that is to say, living, is “federalist” in the<lb/>
present wider sense of the term. All that is really<lb/>
human is contrary to uniformization. Marriage, for<lb/>
instance, is a federal union, because it does not presuppose<lb/>
the identity of the conjoined, but is based,<lb/>
on the contrary, on the diversity of the sexes. Painting<lb/>
is a federal art, for it does not obtain harmonies by<lb/>
mixing all the colors together, but, on the contrary,<lb/>
by respecting their particular and complementary<lb/>
qualities. The redder a red is, the better it will bring<lb/>
out the quality of a very green green. (The totalitarian<lb/>
system conceives of “order” only through the<lb/>
suppression of opposites and of individual qualities.<lb/>
It crushes all the colors together, giving a familiar<lb/>
kind of brown. . . .) The human body is a federal<lb/>
structure, because the life of the whole presupposes<lb/>
the autonomy of each organ, and its particular, original<lb/>
and irreplaceable co-operation. What is more<lb/>
“federal” than the blood, in which countless individual<lb/>
cells of different kinds, red and white corpuscles,<lb/>
platelets, each with its own structure and function,<lb/>
co-operate to carry life to all parts of the body ?<lb/>

</p>
        <p rend="block big"><space/>Thus Switzerland has wedded its different races,<lb/>
created new cultural harmonies, slowly composed a<lb/>
living body of which the twenty-two cantons are the<lb/>
organs, at once autonomous and bound together, and<lb/>
of which an immense number of groups—families,<lb/>
parishes, communes, trades-unions, co-operatives, societies<lb/>
of all kinds, are the cells. In these groups all<lb/>
is still to the measure of man, within reach of the<lb/>
hand, within sound of the voice. In each of these cells<lb/>
every individual can make himself heard, can act with<lb/>
knowledge and see the results of his action, can exercise<lb/>
practically the rights which the law guarantees<lb/>
him.<lb/>
<space/>“The small State,” wrote Jakob Burckhardt, “exists<lb/>
that there may be in the world a corner of earth<lb/>
where the greater part of the inhabitants can enjoy<lb/>
the quality of citizenship in the true sense of the<lb/>
word.<lb/>
<space/>“The small State possesses nothing but the real and<lb/>
genuine liberty whereby it fully compensates for the<lb/>
huge advantages and even the power of the big<lb/>
States.”<lb/>
<space/>We might add, the little State exists in order that<lb/>
there may be somewhere in the world a human community<lb/>

tions to the measure of the real man. Man being real,<lb/>
that is to say responsible and effective only within a<lb/>
human group, all this civic effort has consisted in preserving<lb/>
and harmonizing the groups. This is fundamentally<lb/>
an anti-political effort, and as such diametrically<lb/>
opposite to the current of the present century.<lb/>
<space/>Politics have, in fact, become our master-passion.<lb/>
What are politics ? Like all passions, they escape definition,<lb/>
they are not what we think, they melt into<lb/>
vague generalities when we attempt to define them,<lb/>
but are all the more terribly effective for their elusiveness.<lb/>
For most men they are first of all a matter<lb/>
of opinion, but that opinion is made by the press, the<lb/>
radio. By whom are these directed, and in what interests ?<lb/>
Few know or care to know. Our political opinions,<lb/>
made in series and scarcely modified for individual<lb/>
use, bear on enormous and vague objects, such as<lb/>
“mechanisms of world economics,” “will of the people,”<lb/>
the “guilt” or “innocence” of nations, “races,”<lb/>
“historical necessities” and other entities whose very<lb/>
existence is doubtful. In fact we can form political<lb/>
judgments only when our ignorance grossly simplifies<lb/>
realities and reduces them to some sentimental myth.<lb/>
We can “judge” in this field only when we don’t<lb/>
know what we are talking about. That is why political<lb/>
opinions are particularly violent at present ; the<lb/>
reduction of human realities to a series of “isms”<lb/>
allows us to take sides without effort, on the strength<lb/>

of words, doctrines, forces—such as marxism, fascism,<lb/>
capitalism—which we do not comprehend.<lb/>
<space/>We talk of “interests” that we have not studied,<lb/>
and that the specialists are not able to define. If precise<lb/>
and definite interests were in question we could<lb/>
come to an understanding, but in the absence of real<lb/>
information, of genuine proofs and measures, the<lb/>
door is opened to the most naive passions. In Berlin<lb/>
in 1932 it often happened that a Nazi workman<lb/>
would talk to a communist comrade. After a few minutes<lb/>
they would find that they were using the same<lb/>
words, formulating the same grievances. But they<lb/>
only hated each other the more, for each thought:<lb/>
“How can I hate a man so much who says the same<lb/>
things I do ? He must be a terribly bad fellow !”<lb/>
<space/>Our era is delirious, and this delirium is called<lb/>
politics. Lost in gigantic masses given over to murderous<lb/>
myths, plaything of powers he cannot see, and by<lb/>
whom he cannot make himself heard, the individual<lb/>
feels himself more despised and helpless than he has<lb/>
ever been in the course of history. He has no hold on<lb/>
the realities or unrealities which determine his life,<lb/>
send him off to war, rouse his passions, demand his<lb/>
sacrifice. Either his opinion is not asked, or he has<lb/>
no way of expressing it. Everything is too big for him,<lb/>

freedom-bearing contrast that the spectacle of the<lb/>
Swiss federation offers us.<lb/>
<space/>The President of that League of the Gothard<lb/>
which we mentioned above, wrote us recently: “You<lb/>
ask me to speak to you as a friend, not merely as a<lb/>
political leader. But there is nothing more human<lb/>
than the kind of politics we are making. The justification-for-being<lb/>
of our little country is to save the<lb/>
conception of man, of human dignity, of a real community.<lb/>
All the institutional structures have melted<lb/>
away, and nothing is left but human faces (I am<lb/>
speaking of Switzerland as it is reborn in the League).<lb/>
All that is mass, quantity, anonymity we transform<lb/>
into simple human relationships between man and<lb/>
man. We are recreating personal politics.”<lb/>
<space/>These words are like a manifesto of the only revolution<lb/>
which could still tempt the men of today: the<lb/>
rise of personal realities against the collectivist myths<lb/>
—of groups against the masses—of the human against<lb/>
the political.<lb/>
<space/>Inevitably it will be objected that this “realism,”<lb/>
this practical solidarity, is possible only in a small<lb/>
federal country. “You have yourselves underlined<lb/>
that,” it will be said. “The Swiss example is too small<lb/>

States, economics, ways of killing men ? Is not the<lb/>
general trend of the age exactly opposite to the federalism<lb/>
that you describe ? Are you not being very<lb/>
Utopian ?”<lb/>
<space/>To this we have three answers.<lb/>
The first is that if we want to know exactly what<lb/>
we are talking about when we talk of democracy, of<lb/>
liberty, of tradition, of federal organization, it is in<lb/>
a little State that we must look at the concrete realizations<lb/>
of these words. There only have they remained<lb/>
man-sized, there only can they be understood<lb/>
and verified.<lb/>
<space/>In the second place for those who fear that federalism<lb/>
may be an Utopia we will examine its present<lb/>
chances, as the war is revealing them today.<lb/>
<space/>In 1939 the obstacles to a federal union of European<lb/>
peoples wrere of two kinds: first, the liberal and<lb/>
capitalistic economy refused to organize and proceed<lb/>
to the repartition of raw materials ; and, second, nationalism<lb/>
made the problem of minorities insoluble.<lb/>
But the war will inevitably destroy the bases of the<lb/>
present economy, along with the framework of nationalism.<lb/>
The theoretical possibility of a federation<lb/>
of peoples will thus be constituted, and federalism<lb/>
will appear as the only real alternative to totalitarianism.<lb/>
To individualism and nationalism it will oppose<lb/>
an ideal of co-operation ; to the uniform and obligatory<lb/>
collectivism of the totalitarians it will oppose an<lb/>
ideal of union in diversity, of an organic community.<lb/>

        <p rend="block big"><space/>These theoretical possibilities are tempting. Plans<lb/>
are already being made on all sides. Several are<lb/>
worthy of attention: Union Now, Pan-Europa. Their<lb/>
only fault is precisely that they at’e plans. For federalism<lb/>
is never born of theoretical projects. On the contrary,<lb/>
wherever it has existed in a measure—in Switzerland,<lb/>
in the United States, in the British Commonwealth—it<lb/>
has always instinctively set aside systematic<lb/>
solutions proposed or imposed from the center. The<lb/>
existing federations were born of empirical arrangements,<lb/>
of compromises hardly-won through struggle,<lb/>
and often through war.<lb/>
<space/>The federation of peoples if it is to be born will<lb/>
certainly not be a legal construction, but, on the<lb/>
contrary, a process of vivilication of already existing<lb/>
roots and centers of different orders, some economic,<lb/>
some religious, some cultural, others geographic. . . .<lb/>
<space/>What are these roots, what are these moral foci of<lb/>
a future federation which are beginning to appear in<lb/>
the present chaos ?<lb/>
<space/>Among the people who have been most disappointed<lb/>
by democratic institutions a need of vital liberty<lb/>
still exists. And among the people oppressed by<lb/>
totalitarian institutions a communal feeling is growing<lb/>
up which had ceased to exist in the individualistic<lb/>
democracy. It is the union of these two tendencies<lb/>
which may engender federalism. The federal device<lb/>
brings together paradoxically the “one for all” which<lb/>
defines a community, and the “all for one” which<lb/>

affirms the value of the human person. Moreover, the<lb/>
present war has aggravated the feeling of national<lb/>
differences, but it has also taught the nations to know<lb/>
each other.<lb/>
<space/>To become actuality, federal feeling must have tactics,<lb/>
a technique, and the present war has revealed<lb/>
one. War and revolution have always learned tactics<lb/>
from each other. The French Revolution created<lb/>
the national army, from which Marx got the idea of<lb/>
an organized proletariat. The war of propaganda<lb/>
from 1917-1918 gave Lenin the model for the Russian<lb/>
Revolution, and Hitler, too, refers to it often in<lb/>
Mein Kampf. The political term, “front,” has been<lb/>
borrowed from the armies. Let us in turn use the tactical<lb/>
lessons of this war for the political revolution<lb/>
which will follow.<lb/>
<space/>The great military lesson of this war, as we have<lb/>
pointed out, is that only federal tactics can be opposed<lb/>
to totalitarian tactics. This admirably illustrates<lb/>
the political reality of our day. It is not the centralized<lb/>
pseudo-democracies which will be able to resist<lb/>
the fascist threat, but the federal democracies. The<lb/>
real antithesis, the only genuinely possible one today<lb/>
is: federalism (not democracy in general) versus totalitarianism.<lb/>
The fact that this antithesis has shown itself<lb/>
in crude material facts in the test of war should<lb/>
serve as a lesson for future political action.<lb/>
<space/>Henceforth federalism is not an Utopian ideal, nor<lb/>
a result of wishful thinking. It is a vital necessity, a<lb/>

question of life or death for our civilization. The<lb/>
Democracy of tomorrow will be federalist, or it will<lb/>
not be. No other possible alternative exists.<lb/>
<space/>In a centralized State, however “democratic” it may<lb/>
appear, to cut off one or a few governmental heads<lb/>
is enough to make the whole State fall ; witness the<lb/>
fate of France. But in a federal democracy, as a Swiss<lb/>
politician has said, you would have as many heads to<lb/>
suppress as there are citizens who care for their concrete<lb/>
liberties, for their commune, their parish, their<lb/>
local roots. This resistance is invincible because it is<lb/>
everywhere, and therefore impossible to grasp. Napoleon,<lb/>
who conquered the great centralized states of<lb/>
his day, was baffled by the two countries, Spain and<lb/>
Russia, in which his armies met with local resistances<lb/>
even though the central power was destroyed.<lb/>
<space/>The tactics of federalism consist first of all in reinforcing<lb/>
now, today, all centers of local resistance.<lb/>
Totalitarianism succeeds only when the masses of a<lb/>
nation have been unified by force. But federal tactics<lb/>
can succeed at once, wherever a center exists, and as<lb/>
soon as a new one develops. Federalism exists wherever<lb/>
a man appears w7ho is fully conscious both of<lb/>
his rights and of his responsibilities. Each of us can<lb/>
be federalist, here and now, in his own field of action.<lb/>
Each of us, in the frame of his own personal life, can<lb/>
transform the “Federal Utopia” into reality. Carrying<lb/>
the military lesson a little further, we might say symbolically<lb/>
that federalism begins wherever a depth ap<lb/>

pears, wherever superficiality and standardization of<lb/>
tastes and ideas, the precursors of totalitarianism, are<lb/>
rejected and fought, were it only by a single man.<lb/>
<space/>The average man, as we have said, can be truly and<lb/>
concretely himself only in the framework of a local<lb/>
community. These local communities are the living<lb/>
cells of all federations. But a more exacting and complex<lb/>
man can belong to a plurality of such cells. This<lb/>
is the concrete formula of federal liberty, the equivalent<lb/>
of “liberal” tolerance. In each case man can<lb/>
only find his full self-realization in a federal organization<lb/>
of society, because this allows both obligation<lb/>
and freedom.<lb/>
<space/>The liberalism of the nineteenth century, because<lb/>
it stressed men’s rights rather than their duties,<lb/>
tended to reduce society to what has been aptly called<lb/>
“a dust of individuals.” From this dust the dictators<lb/>
found it easy to make their colossus of clay—the State<lb/>
as Idol. The search for an abstract freedom degenerated<lb/>
into a rejection of all obligations as limits on the<lb/>
absolute liberty of the individual. Yet these bonds—<lb/>
family, religion, the home, the soil—are also the roots<lb/>
through which men draw nourishment for their<lb/>
growth.<lb/>
<space/>Individualistic democracy offered only liberty without<lb/>
any concrete pledge or obligation. It fell to pieces<lb/>
at the first onslaught. Fascism and Communism tolerate<lb/>
only obligations, without liberty. They mutilate<lb/>

the human personality. It is only where man wills to<lb/>
be total that the State can never be totalitarian.<lb/>
<space/>What today prevents men from being entirely human—and<lb/>
even from wanting to be so—is a certain<lb/>
fatalism created by the anarchical development of the<lb/>
machine. Man feels lost in too vast a world. He dares<lb/>
not hope for a return to more normal conditions because<lb/>
he believes that everything is moving inevitably<lb/>
in the direction of even more inhuman giganticism.<lb/>
<space/>To this despairing skepticism, which is widespread,<lb/>
we give our third answer: the malady of the<lb/>
modern world, giganticism, is now reaching its crucial<lb/>
phase. It may, of course, go a little further: the great<lb/>
nations may form three or four blocs of States, their<lb/>
wars may become wars of continents, anonymous or<lb/>
dictatorial tyranny may become more implacable, our<lb/>
protests may be of no avail. But already we can foresee<lb/>
the inevitable end of the adventure. These monstrous<lb/>
super-States, these insane concentrations of<lb/>
power can only end in catastrophe. The great States<lb/>
have already destroyed the small ones, but they are<lb/>
condemned in turn to annihilate each other. Their<lb/>
conflicting imperialisms are mutually destructive. In<lb/>
the end, there will be no victor and no vanquished,<lb/>
only ruins everywhere. Then we will have to reconstruct.<lb/>
We will have before us a blank sheet. The<lb/>
peoples will need a new vision. If civilization is to<lb/>
survive this crisis, it will have no alternative but to<lb/>
come back to realities that are to the measure of<lb/>

man. Then the small state will once again be the<lb/>
model and the ideal, as it was in the great eras of<lb/>
western civilization. Then will come the hour of the<lb/>
federal idea, which Switzerland today incarnates.<lb/>
<space/>We can sum up in the following paradoxical formula:<lb/>
the example of Switzerland tends to show the<lb/>
human advantage of what is small over what is huge,<lb/>
and of what is complex over what is arbitrarily simplified.<lb/>
<lb/>
<space/>A real human community must be of limited dimensions.<lb/>
If we expand its limits too far it ceases to<lb/>
be a community, just as a house would cease to be<lb/>
habitable if the size of the rooms, of the stairways, of<lb/>
the furniture was multiplied a hundred times. Since<lb/>
the size of man is fixed and unchangeable, social, political<lb/>
and economic institutions must take it into account ;<lb/>
they must not grow irrationally. Socially the<lb/>
institution which is to the measure of man is the family ;<lb/>
politically, the commune ; economically, the small<lb/>
business. These Switzerland has known how to preserve.<lb/>
But that it has done so has not in the least prevented<lb/>
it from having a wide vision and accomplishing<lb/>
great things in the material and philanthropic<lb/>
order. To attain these results Switzerland did not begin<lb/>
by destroying the small cells: it federated them,<lb/>
little by little, safeguarding their autonomy and their<lb/>
peculiarities. It did not line them up or group them<lb/>
arbitrarily into a pyramidal system around a single<lb/>

center. It worked, like nature, by means of arrangements,<lb/>
adaptations and compromises. Various networks<lb/>
of alliances grew up around several centers,<lb/>
some of them political, some religious or cultural,<lb/>
others economic. This care to respect diversity in<lb/>
union and autonomy in collaboration leads, as we<lb/>
have seen, to a very complicated political organization,<lb/>
and to an economic structure which is partly<lb/>
individualistic, partly centralized. But though it requires<lb/>
much more effort, much more patience and<lb/>
ingenuity than the totalitarian system, that is the<lb/>
price paid for safeguarding the human aspects of life.<lb/>
The totalitarian system, which creates uniformity by<lb/>
dint of rules and regulations, gains a certain material<lb/>
force, but loses what makes the value of life. The<lb/>
modern mania for simplification and for systematizing<lb/>
is the sign of a laziness of mind and of imagination.<lb/>
It is a fatal malady. To live and to give life is never<lb/>
as simple as to kill. Let us not, then, accuse federalism<lb/>
of being “too complicated.” It is complicated only in<lb/>
the measure in which it is adapted to living reality,<lb/>
and it has the great advantage of demanding of men<lb/>
an effort which commits and at the same time sustains<lb/>
them.<lb/>
<space/>Can we not imagine federalism of the Swiss type<lb/>
extended to other peoples ? True, we have shown that<lb/>
the geographic conditions of Switzerland played a<lb/>
large part in the formation of this regime. But there<lb/>
are certain principles which can be deduced from it<lb/>

that are valid for all countries. The most important<lb/>
of these is the subordination of the central State to<lb/>
local human realities. Let the State, for instance,<lb/>
take charge of large material enterprises, which require<lb/>
a central organization and a collective discipline.<lb/>
That is necessary and reasonable. It is not in<lb/>
the centralization of the postal services or railroads<lb/>
that the danger lies, but in the uniformity imposed<lb/>
on consciences, in the destruction of communities,<lb/>
that is to say, in the centralization of realities which<lb/>
by definition can only exist on a small scale, and are<lb/>
local and personal.<lb/>
<space/>Can we not ask of tomorrow an organization of society<lb/>
which, instead of subordinating everything to<lb/>
material power or to some ideology or “ism,” will<lb/>
take the nature of things and the concrete interests<lb/>
of persons into account ? Can we not dream of a society<lb/>
which would at last distinguish between what is<lb/>
material and what is human, which would centralize<lb/>
those things that can only function when they are so<lb/>
organized, but in which those things that can only<lb/>
live in their own place and way would be left free<lb/>
and autonomous ? Must we call “Utopian” this solution<lb/>
which actually exists in Switzerland, which has<lb/>
proved itself strong for centuries through the most<lb/>
varied epochs, which is, at bottom, good sense itself,<lb/>
and which is, moreover, the only hope left us ?<lb/>

after-tomorrow we may find ourselves tomorrow aimless<lb/>
and therefore weak, beaten beforehand by the<lb/>
totalitarian U topias, which know well enough how to<lb/>
make long plans.<lb/>
<space/>It may be that the world of tomorrow will only<lb/>
prolong and aggravate the vices of the present world.<lb/>
In that case—and it is the most probable one—the<lb/>
federal idea will have time to ripen in the consciences<lb/>
of men. The ills of the world will teach its value to<lb/>
mankind much better than could the most persuasive<lb/>
propaganda. Switzerland, which now lives this federal<lb/>
solution, will have to be silent and hope to be forgotten<lb/>
for a time. The “little seed” will survive in<lb/>
darkness, as best it can.<lb/>

whatever too much exceeds the capacity of the active<lb/>
and responsible individual—the person. When the<lb/>
world has learned this at its own expense perhaps<lb/>
men may ask of the small countries the secret of a<lb/>
more truly human life.<lb/>
<space/>Switzerland has jealously preserved that secret<lb/>
through the ages. The justification of its existence is<lb/>
that it may keep the knowledge for the future. Will<lb/>
it, according to Victor Hugo’s prophecy, “have the<lb/>
last word in history” ? We do not know. But what we<lb/>
do know is that somewhere on earth—in the very<lb/>
heart of the European cyclone—exists a hope, strongly<lb/>
defended, which waits its hour. Its name is Switzerland.<lb/>

MEN and POLITICS<lb/>
<space/>An Autobiography by LOUIS FISCHER<lb/>
"The arresting memoirs of one of the most serious and profound journalists<lb/>
of his generation.”—Raymond Gram Swing<lb/>
"It is a genuine contribution to contemporary history. I don’t see how anyone<lb/>
interested in the world today can afford to miss this vital and important<lb/>
book.”—John Gunther<lb/>
"Mr. Fischer’s work stands far above the ordinary journalistic autobiography<lb/>
in permanent value, because it is written by a man who can appraise<lb/>
as well as describe.”—The Atlantic<lb/>
"No other book gives so intimate, full-bodied and memorable a picture of<lb/>
Europe in the last twenty years … it is one of the most moving and valuable<lb/>
documents of our time.”—Maurice Hindus<lb/>
"MEN AND POLITICS is, without question, the greatest of the foreign<lb/>
correspondent series.”—Chicago Tribune<lb/>
"It will be quoted and debated on a thousand fronts ; it will survive as an<lb/>
important historical document when the writings of Sheean, Van Paassen,<lb/>
Duranty, Reynolds and others are forgotten.”—Boston Herald-Traveler<lb/>
